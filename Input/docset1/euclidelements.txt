PREFACE.

This edition of the Elements of Euclid, undertaken at the request of the prin-
cipals of some of the leading Colleges and Schools of Ireland, is intended to
supply a want much felt by teachers at the present day—the production of a
work which, while giving the unrivalled original in all its integrity, would also
contain the modern conceptions and developments of the portion of Geometry
over which the Elements extend. A cursory examination of the work will show
that the Editor has gone much further in this latter direction than any of his
predecessors, for it will be found to contain, not only more actual matter than
is given in any of theirs with which he is acquainted, but also much of a special
character, which is not given, so far as he is aware, in any former work on the
subject. The great extension of geometrical methods in recent times has made
such a work a necessity for the student, to enable him not only to read with ad-
vantage, but even to understand those mathematical writings of modern times
which require an accurate knowledge of Elementary Geometry, and to which it
is in reality the best introduction.

In compiling his work the Editor has received invaluable assistance from the
late Rev. Professor Townsend, s.f.t.c.d. The book was rewritten and con-
siderably altered in accordance with his suggestions, and to that distinguished
Geometer it is largely indebted for whatever merit it possesses.

The Questions for Examination in the early part of the First Book are in-
tended as specimens, which the teacher ought to follow through the entire work.
Every person who has had experience in tuition knows well the importance of
such examinations in teaching Elementary Geometry.

The Exercises, of which there are over eight hundred, have been all selected
with great care. Those in the body of each Book are intended as applications of
Euclid’s Propositions. They are for the most part of an elementary character,
and may be regarded as common property, nearly every one of them having
appeared already in previous collections. The Exercises at the end of each
Book are more advanced; several are due to the late Professor Townsend, some
are original, and a large number have been taken from two important French
works—Catalan’s Th´eor`emes et Probl`emes de G´eom´etrie El´ementaire, and
the Trait´e de G´eom´etrie, by Rouch´e and De Comberousse.

The second edition has been thoroughly revised and greatly enlarged. The
new matter includes several alternative proofs, important examination questions
on each of the books, an explanation of the ratio of incommensurable quantities,
the ﬁrst twenty-one propositions of Book XI., and an Appendix on the properties
of the Prism, Pyramids, Cylinder, Sphere, and Cone.

The present Edition has been very carefully read throughout, and it is hoped

that few misprints have escaped detection.

The Editor is glad to ﬁnd from the rapid sale of former editions (each 3000
copies) of his Book, and its general adoption in schools, that it is likely to

i

accomplish the double object with which it was written, viz. to supply students
with a Manual that will impart a thorough knowledge of the immortal work
of the great Greek Geometer, and introduce them, at the same time, to some
of the most important conceptions and developments of the Geometry of the
present day.

THE ELEMENTS OF EUCLID.

INTRODUCTION.

Geometry is the Science of ﬁgured Space. Figured Space is of one, two, or three
dimensions, according as it consists of lines, surfaces, or solids. The boundaries
of solids are surfaces; of surfaces, lines; and of lines, points. Thus it is the
province of Geometry to investigate the properties of solids, of surfaces, and
of the ﬁgures described on surfaces. The simplest of all surfaces is the plane,
and that department of Geometry which is occupied with the lines and curves
drawn on a plane is called Plane Geometry; that which demonstrates the prop-
erties of solids, of curved surfaces, and the ﬁgures described on curved surfaces,
is Geometry of Three Dimensions. The simplest lines that can be drawn on a
plane are the right line and circle, and the study of the properties of the point,
the right line, and the circle, is the introduction to Geometry, of which it forms
an extensive and important department. This is the part of Geometry on which
the oldest Mathematical Book in existence, namely, Euclid’s Elements, is writ-
ten, and is the subject of the present volume. The conic sections and other
curves that can be described on a plane form special branches, and complete
the divisions of this, the most comprehensive of all the Sciences. The student
will ﬁnd in Chasles’ Aper¸cu Historique a valuable history of the origin and the
development of the methods of Geometry.

In the following work, when ﬁgures are not drawn, the student should con-
struct them from the given directions. The Propositions of Euclid will be printed
in larger type, and will be referred to by Roman numerals enclosed in brackets.
Thus [III. xxxii.] will denote the 32nd Proposition of the 3rd Book. The num-
ber of the Book will be given only when diﬀerent from that under which the
reference occurs. The general and the particular enunciation of every Propo-
sition will be given in one. By omitting the letters enclosed in parentheses we
have the general enunciation, and by reading them, the particular. The anno-
tations will be printed in smaller type. The following symbols will be used in
them:—

will be denoted by J

Circle
Triangle
Parallelogram
Parallel lines
Perpendicular
In addition to these we shall employ the usual symbols +, −, &c. of Algebra,
and also the sign of congruence, namely ≡. This symbol has been introduced
by the illustrious Gauss.

BOOK I.

THEORY OF ANGLES, TRIANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, AND

PARALLELOGRAMS.

DEFINITIONS.

The Point.

i. A point is that which has position but not dimensions.
A geometrical magnitude which has three dimensions, that is, length, breadth, and thick-
ness, is a solid; that which has two dimensions, such as length and breadth, is a surface; and
that which has but one dimension is a line. But a point is neither a solid, nor a surface, nor
a line; hence it has no dimensions—that is, it has neither length, breadth, nor thickness.

The Line.

ii. A line is length without breadth.
A line is space of one dimension. If it had any breadth, no matter how small, it would
be space of two dimensions; and if in addition it had any thickness it would be space of three
dimensions; hence a line has neither breadth nor thickness.

iii. The intersections of lines and their extremities are points.
iv. A line which lies evenly between its extreme
points is called a straight or right line, such as AB.

If a point move without changing its direction it will describe a right line. The direction in
which a point moves in called its “sense.” If the moving point continually changes its direction
it will describe a curve; hence it follows that only one right line can be drawn between two
points. The following Illustration is due to Professor Henrici:—“If we suspend a weight by a
string, the string becomes stretched, and we say it is straight, by which we mean to express
that it has assumed a peculiar deﬁnite shape. If we mentally abstract from this string all
thickness, we obtain the notion of the simplest of all lines, which we call a straight line.”

The Plane.

v. A surface is that which has length and breadth.
A surface is space of two dimensions. It has no thickness, for if it had any, however small,

it would be space of three dimensions.

vi. When a surface is such that the right line joining any two arbitrary

points in it lies wholly in the surface, it is called a plane.

A plane is perfectly ﬂat and even, like the surface of still water, or of a smooth ﬂoor.—

Newcomb.

Figures.

vii. Any combination of points, of lines, or of points and lines in a plane, is
called a plane ﬁgure. If a ﬁgure be formed of points only it is called a stigmatic
ﬁgure; and if of right lines only, a rectilineal ﬁgure.

viii. Points which lie on the same right line are called collinear points. A

ﬁgure formed of collinear points is called a row of points.

The Angle.

ix. The inclination of two right lines extending out from one point in diﬀerent

directions is called a rectilineal angle.

x. The two lines are called the legs, and the point the vertex of the angle.
A light line drawn from the vertex and turning about it
in the plane of the angle, from the position of coincidence
with one leg to that of coincidence with the other, is said to
turn through the angle, and the angle is the greater as the
quantity of turning is the greater. Again, since the line may
turn from one position to the other in either of two ways,
two angles are formed by two lines drawn from a point.

Thus if AB, AC be the legs, a line may turn from the
position AB to the position AC in the two ways indicated
by the arrows. The smaller of the angles thus formed is to be
understood as the angle contained by the lines. The larger,
called a re-entrant angle, seldom occurs in the “Elements.”

xi. Designation of Angles.—A particular angle in a ﬁgure is denoted by
three letters, as BAC, of which the middle one, A, is at the vertex, and the
other two along the legs. The angle is then read BAC.

xii. The angle formed by joining two or more angles together is called
their sum. Thus the sum of the two angles ABC, P QR is the angle AB0R,
formed by applying the side QP to the side BC,
so that the vertex Q shall fall on the vertex B,
and the side QR on the opposite side of BC
from BA.

xiii. When the sum of two angles BAC,
CAD is such that the legs BA, AD form one
right line, they are called supplements of each
other.

Hence, when one line stands on another, the two angles which it makes on the same side

of that on which it stands are supplements of each other.

3

xiv. When one line stands on another, and
makes the adjacent angles at both sides of itself
equal, each of the angles is called a right angle,
and the line which stands on the other is called a
perpendicular to it.

Hence a right angle is equal to its supplement.
xv. An acute angle is one which is less than

a right angle, as A.

xvi. An obtuse angle is one which is greater than a right angle, as BAC.
The supplement of an acute angle is obtuse, and conversely, the supplement of an obtuse

angle is acute.

xvii. When the sum of two angles is a right angle,
each is called the complement of the other. Thus, if
the angle BAC be right, the angles BAD, DAC are
complements of each other.

Concurrent Lines.

xviii. Three or more right lines passing through

the same point are called concurrent lines.

xix. A system of more than three concurrent lines is called a pencil of lines.
Each line of a pencil is called a ray, and the common point through which the
rays pass is called the vertex.

The Triangle.

xx. A triangle is a ﬁgure formed by three right lines joined end to end. The

three lines are called its sides.

xxi. A triangle whose three sides are unequal is said to be scalene, as A;
a triangle having two sides equal, to be isosceles, as B; and and having all its
sides equal, to be equilateral, as C.

xxii. A right-angled triangle is one that has one of its angles a right angle,

as D. The side which subtends the right angle is called the hypotenuse.

4

E.

xxiii. An obtuse-angled triangle is one that has one of its angles obtuse, as

xxiv. An acute-angled triangle is one that has its three angles acute, as F .

xxv. An exterior angle of a triangle is one that is formed by any side and

the continuation of another side.

Hence a triangle has six exterior angles; and also each exterior angle is the supplement of

the adjacent interior angle.

The Polygon.

xxvi. A rectilineal ﬁgure bounded by more than three right lines is usually

called a polygon.

xxvii. A polygon is said to be convex when it has no re-entrant angle.
xxviii. A polygon of four sides is called a quadrilateral.
xxix. A quadrilateral whose four sides are equal is called a lozenge.
xxx. A lozenge which has a right angle is called a square.
xxxi. A polygon which has ﬁve sides is called a pentagon; one which has six

sides, a hexagon, and so on.

The Circle.

xxxii. A circle is a plane ﬁgure formed by a curved
line called the circumference, and is such that all right
lines drawn from a certain point within the ﬁgure to the
circumference are equal to one another. This point is
called the centre.

xxxiii. A radius of a circle is any right line drawn

from the centre to the circumference, such as CD.

xxxiv. A diameter of a circle is a right line drawn through the centre and

terminated both ways by the circumference, such as AB.

From the deﬁnition of a circle it follows at once that the path of a movable point in a
plane which remains at a constant distance from a ﬁxed point is a circle; also that any point
P in the plane is inside, outside, or on the circumference of a circle according as its distance
from the centre is less than, greater than, or equal to, the radius.

Postulates.

Let it be granted that—
i. A right line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.
When we consider a straight line contained between two ﬁxed points which are its ends,

such a portion is called a ﬁnite straight line.

ii. A terminated right line may be produced to any length in a right line.

5

Every right line may extend without limit in either direction or in both. It is in these
cases called an indeﬁnite line. By this postulate a ﬁnite right line may be supposed to be
produced, whenever we please, into an indeﬁnite right line.

iii. A circle may be described from any centre, and with any distance from

that centre as radius.

If there be two points A and B, and if with any instruments,
such as a ruler and pen, we draw a line from A to B, this will
evidently have some irregularities, and also some breadth and
thickness. Hence it will not be a geometrical line no matter how nearly it may approach to
one. This is the reason that Euclid postulates the drawing of a right line from one point to
another. For if it could be accurately done there would be no need for his asking us to let it be
granted. Similar observations apply to the other postulates. It is also worthy of remark that
Euclid never takes for granted the doing of anything for which a geometrical construction,
founded on other problems or on the foregoing postulates, can be given.

Axioms.

i. Things which are equal to the same, or to equals, are equal to each other.
Thus, if there be three things, and if the ﬁrst, and the second, be each equal to the third,
we infer by this axiom that the ﬁrst is equal to the second. This axiom relates to all kinds of
magnitude. The same is true of Axioms ii., iii., iv., v., vi., vii., ix.; but viii., x., xi., xii., are
strictly geometrical.

ii. If equals be added to equals the sums will be equal.
iii. If equals be taken from equals the remainders will be equal.
iv. If equals be added to unequals the sums will be unequal.
v. If equals be taken from unequals the remainders will be unequal.
vi. The doubles of equal magnitudes are equal.
vii. The halves of equal magnitudes are equal.
viii. Magnitudes that can be made to coincide are equal.
The placing of one geometrical magnitude on another, such as a line on a line, a triangle
on a triangle, or a circle on a circle, &c., is called superposition. The superposition employed
in Geometry is only mental, that is, we conceive one magnitude placed on the other; and
then, if we can prove that they coincide, we infer, by the present axiom, that they are equal.
Superposition involves the following principle, of which, without explicitly stating it, Euclid
makes frequent use:—“Any ﬁgure may be transferred from one position to another without
change of form or size.”

ix. The whole is greater than its part.
This axiom is included in the following, which is a fuller statement:—
ix0. The whole is equal to the sum of all its parts.
x. Two right lines cannot enclose a space.
This is equivalent to the statement, “If two right lines have two points common to both,
they coincide in direction,” that is, they form but one line, and this holds true even when one
of the points is at inﬁnity.

xi. All right angles are equal to one another.
This can be proved as follows:—Let there be two right lines AB, CD, and two perpendic-

ulars to them, namely, EF , GH, then if AB, CD be made to coincide by superposition, so

that the point E will coincide with G; then since a right angle is equal to its supplement, the

line EF must coincide with GH. Hence the angle AEF is equal to CGH.

xii. If two right lines (AB, CD) meet a third line (AC), so as to make the
sum of the two interior angles (BAC, ACD) on the same side less than two
right angles, these lines being produced shall meet at some ﬁnite distance.

This axiom is the converse of Prop. xvii., Book I.

Explanation of Terms.

Axioms.—“Elements of human reason,” according to Dugald Stewart, are
certain general propositions, the truths of which are self-evident, and which are
so fundamental, that they cannot be inferred from any propositions which are
more elementary; in other words, they are incapable of demonstration. “That
two sides of a triangle are greater than the third” is, perhaps, self-evident; but
it is not an axiom, inasmuch as it can be inferred by demonstration from other
propositions; but we can give no proof of the proposition that “things which are
equal to the same are equal to one another,” and, being self-evident, it is an
axiom.

Propositions which are not axioms are properties of ﬁgures obtained by pro-

cesses of reasoning. They are divided into theorems and problems.

A Theorem is the formal statement of a property that may be demonstrated
from known propositions. These propositions may themselves be theorems or
axioms. A theorem consists of two parts, the hypothesis, or that which is as-
sumed, and the conclusion, or that which is asserted to follow therefrom. Thus,
in the typical theorem,

If X is Y, then Z is W,

(i.)

the hypothesis is that X is Y , and the conclusion is that Z is W .

Converse Theorems.—Two theorems are said to be converse, each of the
other, when the hypothesis of either is the conclusion of the other. Thus the
converse of the theorem (i.) is—

If Z is W, then X is Y.

(ii.)

From the two theorems (i.) and (ii.) we may infer two others, called their

contrapositives. Thus the contrapositive

of (i.) is, If Z is not W , then X is not Y ;
of (ii.) is, If X is not Y , then Z is not W .

(iii.)
(iv.)

The theorem (iv.) is called the obverse of (i.), and (iii.) the obverse of (ii.).
A Problem is a proposition in which something is proposed to be done, such
as a line to be drawn, or a ﬁgure to be constructed, under some given conditions.

7

The Solution of a problem is the method of construction which accomplishes

the required end.

The Demonstration is the proof, in the case of a theorem, that the conclusion
follows from the hypothesis; and in the case of a problem, that the construction
accomplishes the object proposed.

The Enunciation of a problem consists of two parts, namely, the data, or

things supposed to be given, and the quaesita, or things required to be done.

Postulates are the elements of geometrical construction, and occupy the same

relation with respect to problems as axioms do to theorems.

A Corollary is an inference or deduction from a proposition.
A Lemma is an auxiliary proposition required in the demonstration of a

principal proposition.

any other geometrical ﬁgure.

A Secant or Transversal is a line which cuts a system of lines, a circle, or

Congruent ﬁgures are those that can be made to coincide by superposi-
tion. They agree in shape and size, but diﬀer in position. Hence it follows,
by Axiom viii., that corresponding parts or portions of congruent ﬁgures are
congruent, and that congruent ﬁgures are equal in every respect.

Rule of Identity.—Under this name the following principle will be sometimes
referred to:—“If there is but one X and one Y , then, from the fact that X is
Y , it necessarily follows that Y is X.”—Syllabus.

PROP. I.—Problem.

On a given ﬁnite right line (AB) to construct an equilateral triangle.

Sol.—With A as centre, and AB
as radius, describe the circle BCD
(Post. iii.). With B as centre, and BA
as radius, describe the circle ACE, cut-
ting the former circle in C. Join CA,
CB (Post. i.). Then ABC is the equi-
lateral triangle required.

Dem.—Because A is the centre of
the circle BCD, AC is equal to AB
(Def. xxxii.). Again, because B is the
centre of the circle ACE, BC is equal to BA. Hence we have proved.

and

AC = AB,
BC = AB.

But things which are equal to the same are equal to one another (Axiom i.);
therefore AC is equal to BC; therefore the three lines AB, BC, CA are equal
to one another. Hence the triangle ABC is equilateral (Def. xxi.); and it is
described on the given line AB, which was required to be done.

Exercises.

The following exercises are to be solved when the pupil has mastered the First Book:—
1. If the lines AF , BF be joined, the ﬁgure ACBF is a lozenge.
2. If AB be produced to D and E, the triangles CDF and CEF are equilateral.
3. If CA, CB be produced to meet the circles again in G and H, the points G, F , H are

collinear, and the triangle GCH is equilateral.

4. If CF be joined, CF 2 = 3AB2.
5. Describe a circle in the space ACB, bounded by the line AB and the two circles.

PROP. II.—Problem.

From a given point (A) to draw a right line equal to a given ﬁnite right line

(BC).

Sol.—Join AB (Post. i.); on AB de-
scribe the equilateral triangle ABD [i.].
With B as centre, and BC as radius, de-
scribe the circle ECH (Post iii.). Pro-
duce DB to meet the circle ECH in E
(Post. ii.). With D as centre, and DE as
radius, describe the circle EF G (Post. iii.).
Produce DA to meet this circle in F . AF
is equal to BC.

Dem.—Because D is the centre of
the circle EF G, DF is equal to DE
(Def. xxxii.). And because DAB is an
equilateral triangle, DA is equal to DB
(Def. xxi.). Hence we have

and

DF = DE,
DA = DB;

and taking the latter from the former, the remainder AF is equal to the remain-
der BE (Axiom iii.). Again, because B is the centre of the circle ECH, BC is
equal to BE; and we have proved that AF is equal to BE; and things which
are equal to the same thing are equal to one another (Axiom i.). Hence AF

9

is equal to BC. Therefore from the given point A the line AF has been drawn
equal to BC.

It is usual with commentators on Euclid to say that he allows the use of the rule and
compass. Were such the case this Proposition would have been unnecessary. The fact is,
Euclid’s object was to teach Theoretical and not Practical Geometry, and the only things
he postulates are the drawing of right lines and the describing of circles. If he allowed the
mechanical use of the rule and compass he could give methods of solving many problems that
go beyond the limits of the “geometry of the point, line, and circle.”—See Notes D, F at the
end of this work.

Exercises.

1. Solve the problem when the point A is in the line BC itself.
2. Inﬂect from a given point A to a given line BC a line equal to a given line. State the

number of solutions.

PROP. III.—Problem.

From the greater (AB) of two given right lines to cut oﬀ a part equal to (C)

the less.

Sol.—From A, one of the extremities of
AB, draw the right line AD equal to C [ii.];
and with A as centre, and AD as radius, de-
scribe the circle EDF (Post. iii.) cutting AB
in E. AE shall be equal to C.

Dem.—Because A is the centre of the circle
EDF , AE is equal to AD (Def. xxxii.), and
C is equal to AD (const.); and things which
are equal to the same are equal to one another
(Axiom i.); therefore AE is equal to C. Where-
fore from AB, the greater of the two given lines, a part, AE, has been out oﬀ
equal to C, the less.

Questions for Examination.

1. What previous problem is employed in the solution of this?
2. What postulate?
3. What axiom in the demonstration?
4. Show how to produce the less of two given lines until the whole produced line becomes

equal to the greater.

PROP. IV.—Theorem.

If two triangles (BAC, EDF ) have two sides (BA, AC) of one equal re-
spectively to two sides (ED, DF ) of the other, and have also the angles (A, D)
included by those sides equal, the triangles shall be equal in every respect—that
is, their bases or third sides (BC, EF ) shall be equal, and the angles (B, C)
at the base of one shall be respectively equal to the angles (E, F ) at the base of
the other; namely, those shall be equal to which the equal sides are opposite.

10

Dem.—Let us conceive the triangle
BAC to be applied to EDF , so that the
point A shall coincide with D, and the
line AB with DE, and that the point C
shall be on the same side of DE as F ;
then because AB is equal to DE, the
point B shall coincide with E. Again,
because the angle BAC is equal to the
angle EDF , the line AC shall coincide with DF ; and since AC is equal to DF
(hyp.), the point C shall coincide with F ; and we have proved that the point B
coincides with E. Hence two points of the line BC coincide with two points of
the line EF ; and since two right lines cannot enclose a space, BC must coincide
with EF . Hence the triangles agree in every respect; therefore BC is equal to
EF , the angle B is equal to the angle E, the angle C to the angle F , and the
triangle BAC to the triangle EDF .

Questions for Examination.

1. How many parts in the hypothesis of this Proposition? Ans. Three. Name them.
2. How many in the conclusion? Name them.
3. What technical term is applied to ﬁgures which agree in everything but position? Ans.

They are said to be congruent.

4. What is meant by superposition?
5. What axiom is made use of in superposition?
6. How many parts in a triangle? Ans. Six; namely, three sides and three angles.
7. When it is required to prove that two triangles are congruent, how many parts of one
must be given equal to corresponding parts of the other? Ans. In general, any three except
the three angles. This will be established in Props. viii. and xxvi., taken along with iv.

8. What property of two lines having two common points is quoted in this Proposition?

They must coincide.

Exercises.

1. The line that bisects the vertical angle of an isosceles triangle bisects the base perpen-

dicularly.

2. If two adjacent sides of a quadrilateral be equal, and the diagonal bisects the angle

between them, their other sides are equal.

3. If two lines be at right angles, and if each bisect the other, then any point in either is

equally distant from the extremities of the other.

4. If equilateral triangles be described on the sides of any triangle, the distances between
the vertices of the original triangle and the opposite vertices of the equilateral triangles are
equal. (This Proposition should be proved after the student has read Prop. xxxii.)

PROP. V.—Theorem.

The angles (ABC, ACB) at the base (BC) of an isosceles triangle are equal
to one another, and if the equal sides (AB, AC) be produced, the external angles
(DEC, ECB) below the base shall be equal.

11

Dem.—In BD take any point F , and from
AE, the greater, cut oﬀ AG equal to AF [iii].
Join BG, CF (Post. i.). Because AF is equal to
AG (const.), and AC is equal to AB (hyp.), the
two triangles F AC, GAB have the sides F A,
AC in one respectively equal to the sides GA,
AB in the other; and the included angle A is
common to both triangles. Hence [iv.] the base
F C is equal to GB, the angle AF C is equal to
AGB, and the angle ACF is equal to the angle
ABG.

Again, because AF is equal to AG (const.),

and AB to AC (hyp.), the remainder, BF , is equal to CG (Axiom iii); and we
have proved that F C is equal to GB, and the angle BF C equal to the angle
CGB. Hence the two triangles BF C, CGB have the two sides BF , F C in one
equal to the two sides CG, GB in the other; and the angle BF C contained
by the two sides of one equal to the angle CGB contained by the two sides
of the other. Therefore [iv.] these triangles have the angle F BC equal to the
angle GCB, and these are the angles below the base. Also the angle F CB equal
to GBC; but the whole angle F CA has been proved equal to the whole angle
GBA. Hence the remaining angle ACB is equal to the remaining angle ABC,
and these are the angles at the base.

Observation.—The great diﬃculty which be-
ginners ﬁnd in this Proposition is due to the fact
that the two triangles ACF , ABG overlap each
other. The teacher should make these triangles sep-
arate, as in the annexed diagram, and point out the
corresponding parts thus:—

AF = AG,

AC = AB;

angle F AC = angle GAB.

Hence [iv.],

and

angle ACF = angle ABG.

angle AF C = angle AGB.

The student should also be shown how to apply one of the triangles to the other, so as to
bring them into coincidence. Similar Illustrations may be given of the triangles BF C, CGB.
The following is a very easy proof of this Proposition.
Conceive the 4 ACB to be turned, without alteration, round
the line AC, until it falls on the other side. Let ACD be its
new position; then the angle ADC of the displaced triangle
is evidently equal to the angle ABC, with which it originally
coincided. Again, the two 4s BAC, CAD have the sides
BA, AC of one respectively equal to the sides AC, AD of
the other, and the included angles equal; therefore [iv.] the
angle ACB opposite to the side AB is equal to the angle
ADC opposite to the side AC; but the angle ADC is equal
to ABC; therefore ACB is equal to ABC.

Cor.—Every equilateral triangle is equiangular.

12

Def.—A line in any ﬁgure, such as AC in the preceding diagram, which is
such that, by folding the plane of the ﬁgure round it, one part of the diagram
will coincide with the other, is called an axis of symmetry of the ﬁgure.

Exercises.

1. Prove that the angles at the base are equal without producing the sides. Also by

producing the sides through the vertex.

2. Prove that the line joining the point A to the intersection of the lines CF and BG is

an axis of symmetry of the ﬁgure.

3. If two isosceles triangles be on the same base, and be either at the same or at opposite
sides of it, the line joining their vertices is an axis of symmetry of the ﬁgure formed by them.
4. Show how to prove this Proposition by assuming as an axiom that every angle has a

bisector.

5. Each diagonal of a lozenge is an axis of symmetry of the lozenge.
6. If three points be taken on the sides of an equilateral triangle, namely, one on each side,

at equal distances from the angles, the lines joining them form a new equilateral triangle.

PROP. VI.—Theorem.

If two angles (B, C) of a triangle be equal, the sides (AC, AB) opposite to

them are also equal.

Dem.—If AB, AC are not equal, one must be greater
than the other. Suppose AB is the greater, and that the
part BD is equal to AC. Join CD (Post. i.). Then the
two triangles DBC, ACB have BD equal to AC, and BC
common to both. Therefore the two sides DB, BC in one
are equal to the two sides AC, CB in the other; and the
angle DBC in one is equal to the angle ACB in the other
(hyp). Therefore [iv.] the triangle DBC is equal to the
triangle ACB—the less to the greater, which is absurd; hence AC, AB are not
unequal, that is, they are equal.

Questions for Examination.

1. What is the hypothesis in this Proposition?
2. What Proposition is this the converse of?
3. What is the obverse of this Proposition?
4. What is the obverse of Prop. v.?
5. What is meant by an indirect proof?
6. How does Euclid generally prove converse Propositions?
7. What false assumption is made in the demonstration?
8. What does this assumption lead to?

PROP. VII—Theorem.

If two triangles (ACB, ADB) on the same base (AB) and on the same side
of it have one pair of conterminous sides (AC, AD) equal to one another, the
other pair of conterminous sides (BC, BD) must be unequal.

13

Dem.—1. Let the vertex of each triangle be without
the other. Join CD. Then because AD is equal to AC
(hyp.), the triangle ACD is isosceles; therefore [v.]
the
angle ACD is equal to the angle ADC; but ADC is greater
than BDC (Axiom ix.); therefore ACD is greater than
BDC: much, more is BCD greater than BDC. Now if the
side BD were equal to BC, the angle BCD would be equal
to BDC [v.]; but it has been proved to be greater. Hence
BD is not equal to BC.

2. Let the vertex of one triangle ADB
fall within the other triangle ACB. Pro-
duce the sides AC, AD to E and F .
Then because AC is equal to AD (hyp.),
the triangle ACD is isosceles, and [v.]
the external angles ECD, F DC at the
other side of the base CD are equal; but
ECD is greater than BCD (Axiom ix.).
Therefore F DC is greater than BCD:
much more is BDC greater than BCD;
but if BC were equal to BD, the angle BDC would be equal to BCD [v.];
therefore BC cannot be equal to BD.

3. If the vertex D of the second triangle fall on the line BC, it is evident

that BC and BD are unequal.

Questions for Examination.

1. What use is made of Prop. vii.? Ans. As a lemma to Prop. viii.
2. In the demonstration of Prop. vii. the contrapositive of Prop. v. occurs; show where.
3. Show that two circles can intersect each other only in one point on the same side of
the line joining their centres, and hence that two circles cannot have more than two points of
intersection.

PROP. VIII.—Theorem.

If two triangles (ABC, DEF ) have
two sides (AB, AC) of one respectively
equal to two sides (DE, DF ) of the
other, and have also the base (BC) of
one equal to the base (EF ) of the other;
then the two triangles shall be equal, and
the angles of one shall be respectively
equal to the angles of the other—namely,
those shall be equal to which the equal sides are opposite.

Dem.—Let the triangle ABC be applied to DEF , so that the point B will
coincide with E, and the line BC with the line EF ; then because BC is equal
to EF , the point C shall coincide with F . Then if the vertex A fall on the same

14

side of EF as the vertex D, the point A must coincide with D; for if not, let
it take a diﬀerent position G; then we have EG equal to BA, and BA is equal
to ED (hyp.). Hence (Axiom i.) EG is equal to ED:
in like manner, F G is
equal to F D, and this is impossible [vii.]. Hence the point A must coincide with
D, and the triangle ABC agrees in every respect with the triangle DEF ; and
therefore the three angles of one are respectively equal to the three angles of the
other—namely, A to D, B to E, and C to F , and the two triangles are equal.
This Proposition is the converse of iv., and is the second case of the con-

gruence of triangles in the Elements.

Philo’s Proof.—Let the equal bases be applied as in the foregoing proof, but let the vertices
be on the opposite sides; then let BGC be the position which EDF takes. Join AG. Then
because BG = BA, the angle BAG = BGA. In like manner the angle CAG = CGA. Hence
the whole angle BAC = BGC; but BGC = EDF therefore BAC = EDF .

PROP. IX.—Problem.

To bisect a given rectilineal angle (BAC).

Sol.—In AB take any point D, and cut oﬀ
[iii.] AE equal to AD. Join DE (Post. i.), and
upon it, on the side remote from A, describe the
equilateral triangle DEF [i.] Join AF . AF bisects
the given angle BAC.

Dem.—The triangles DAF , EAF have the
side AD equal to AE (const.) and AF common;
therefore the two sides DA, AF are respectively
equal to EA, AF , and the base DF is equal to
the base EF , because they are the sides of an
equilateral triangle (Def. xxi.). Therefore [viii.]
the angle DAF is equal to the angle EAF ; hence
the angle BAC is bisected by the line AF .

Cor.—The line AF is an axis of symmetry of the ﬁgure.

15

Questions for Examination.

1. Why does Euclid describe the equilateral triangle on the side remote from A?
2. In what case would the construction fail, if the equilateral triangle were described on

the other side of DE?

Exercises.

1. Prove this Proposition without using Prop. viii.
2. Prove that AF is perpendicular to DE.
3. Prove that any point in AF is equally distant from the points D and E.
4. Prove that any point in AF is equally distant from the lines AB, AC.

PROP. X.—Problem.

To bisect a given ﬁnite right line (AB).

Sol.—Upon AB describe an equilateral triangle
ACB [i.]. Bisect the angle ACB by the line CD [ix.],
meeting AB in D, then AB is bisected in D.

Dem.—The two triangles ACD, BCD, have the
side AC equal to BC, being the sides of an equilateral
triangle, and CD common. Therefore the two sides
AC, CD in one are equal to the two sides BC, CD
in the other; and the angle ACD is equal to the angle
BCD (const.). Therefore the base AD is equal to the
base DB [iv.]. Hence AB is bisected in D.

Exercises.

1. Show how to bisect a ﬁnite right line by describing two circles.
2. Every point equally distant from the points A, B is in the line CD.

PROP. XI.—Problem.

From a given point (C) in
a given right line (AB) to draw
a right line perpendicular to the
given line.

Sol.—In AC take any point
D, and make CE equal to CD
[iii.]. Upon DE describe an equi-
lateral triangle DF E [i.].
Join
CF . Then CF shall be at right angles to AB.

Dem.—The two triangles DCF , ECF have CD equal to CE (const.) and
CF common; therefore the two sides CD, CF in one are respectively equal
to the two sides CE, CF in the other, and the base DF is equal to the base
EF , being the sides of an equilateral triangle (Def. xxi.); therefore [viii.] the
angle DCE is equal to the angle ECF , and they are adjacent angles. Therefore
(Def. xiii.) each of them is a right angle, and CF is perpendicular to AB at the
point C.

2. Prove Prop. xi. without using Prop. viii.

6. Find a point that shall be equidistant from three given points.

PROP. XII.—Problem.

To draw a perpendicular to a given indeﬁnite right line (AB) from a given

point (C) without it.

Sol.—Take any point D on the
other side of AB, and describe
(Post. iii.) a circle, with C as cen-
tre, and CD as radius, meeting AB
in the points F and G. Bisect F G
in H [x.]. Join CH (Post. i.). CH
shall be at right angles to AB.

Dem.—Join CF , CG. Then the

two triangles F HC, GHC have F H equal to GH (const.), and HC com-
mon; and the base CF equal to the base CG, being radii of the circle F DG
(Def. xxxii.). Therefore the angle CHF is equal to the angle CHG [viii.],
and, being adjacent angles, they are right angles (Def. xiii.). Therefore CH is
perpendicular to AB.

Exercises.

1. Prove that the circle cannot meet AB in more than two points.
2. If one angle of a triangle be equal to the sum of the other two, the triangle can be
divided into the sum of two isosceles triangles, and the base is equal to twice the line from its
middle point to the opposite angle.

PROP. XIII.—Theorem.

The adjacent angles (ABC, ABD) which one right line (AB) standing on
another (CD) makes with it are either both right angles, or their sum is equal
to two right angles.

17

Dem.—If AB is perpendicular to CD, as in ﬁg. 1, the angles ABC, ABD
are right angles. If not, draw BE perpendicular to CD [xi.]. Now the angle
CBA is equal to the sum of the two angles CBE, EBA (Def. xi.). Hence,
adding the angle ABD, the sum of the angles CBA, ABD is equal to the sum
of the three angles CBE, EBA, ABD. In like manner, the sum of the angles
CBE, EBD is equal to the sum of the three angles CBE, EBA, ABD. And
things which are equal to the same are equal to one another. Therefore the sum
of the angles CBA, ABD is equal to the sum of the angles CBE, EBD; but
CBE, EBD are right angles; therefore the sum of the angles CBA, ABD is
two right angles.

Or thus: Denote the angle EBA by θ; then evidently

the angle

the angle

therefore

CBA = right angle + θ;
ABD = right angle − θ;
CBA + ABD = two right angles.

Cor. 1.—The sum of two supplemental angles is two right angles.
Cor. 2.—Two right lines cannot have a common segment.
Cor. 3.—The bisector of any angle bisects the corresponding re-entrant angle.
Cor. 4.—The bisectors of two supplemental angles are at right angles to each

other.

Cor. 5.—The angle EBA is half the diﬀerence of the angles CBA, ABD.

PROP. XIV.–Theorem.

If at a point (B) in a right line (BA) two
other right lines (CB, BD) on opposite sides
make the adjacent angles (CBA, ABD) to-
gether equal to two right angles, these two
right lines form one continuous line.

Dem.—If BD be not the continuation of
CB, let BE be its continuation. Now, since
CBE is a right line, and BA stands on it, the
sum of the angles CBA, ABE is two right
angles (xiii.); and the sum of the angles CBA, ABD is two right angles (hyp.);

18

therefore the sum of the angles CBA, ABE is equal to the sum of the angles
CBA, ABD. Reject the angle CBA, which is common, and we have the angle
ABE equal to the angle ABD—that is, a part equal to the whole—which is
absurd. Hence BD must be in the same right line with CB.

PROP. XV.—Theorem.

If two right lines (AB, CD) intersect one another, the opposite angles are

equal (CEA = DEB, and BEC = AED).

Dem.—Because the line AE stands on CD,
the sum of the angles CEA, AED is two right
angles [xiii.]; and because the line CE stands on
AB, the sum of the angles BEC, CEA is two
right angles; therefore the sum of the angles CEA,
AED is equal to the sum of the angles BEC,
CEA. Reject the angle CEA, which is common,
and we have the angle AED equal to BEC.
In
like manner, the angle CEA is equal to DEB.

The foregoing proof may be brieﬂy given, by saying that opposite angles are

equal because they have a common supplement.

Questions for Examination on Props. XIII., XIV., XV.

1. What problem is required in Euclid’s proof of Prop. xiii.?
2. What theorem? Ans. No theorem, only the axioms.
3. If two lines intersect, how many pairs of supplemental angles do they make?
4. What relation does Prop. xiv. bear to Prop. xiii.?
5. What three lines in Prop. xiv. are concurrent?
6. What caution is required in the enunciation of Prop. xiv.?
7. State the converse of Prop. xv. Prove it.
8. What is the subject of Props. xiii., xiv., xv.? Ans. Angles at a point.

PROP. XVI.—Theorem.

If any side (BC) of a triangle (ABC) be pro-
duced, the exterior angle (ACD) is greater than ei-
ther of the interior non-adjacent angles.

Dem.—Bisect AC in E [x.]. Join BE (Post. i.).
Produce it, and from the produced part cut oﬀ EF
equal to BE [iii]. Join CF . Now because EC is
equal to EA (const.), and EF is equal to EB, the
triangles CEF , AEB have the sides CE, EF in one
equal to the sides AE, EB in the other; and the
angle CEF equal to AEB [xv.]. Therefore [iv.] the
angle ECF is equal to EAB; but the angle ACD is greater than ECF ; therefore
the angle ACD is greater than EAB.

19

In like manner it may be shown, if the side AC be produced, that the exterior
angle BCG is greater than the angle ABC; but BCG is equal to ACD [xv.].
Hence ACD is greater than ABC. Therefore ACD is greater than either of the
interior non-adjacent angles A or B of the triangle ABC.

Cor. 1.—The sum of the three interior angles of the triangle BCF is equal

to the sum of the three interior angles of the triangle ABC.
Cor. 2.—The area of BCF is equal to the area of ABC.
Cor. 3.—The lines BA and CF , if produced, cannot meet at any ﬁnite
distance. For, if they met at any ﬁnite point X, the triangle CAX would have
an exterior angle BAC equal to the interior angle ACX.

PROP. XVII.—Theorem.

Any two angles (B, C) of a triangle (ABC) are together less than two right

angles.

Dem.—Produce BC to D; then the exterior angle
ACD is greater than ABC [xvi.]: to each add the
angle ACB, and we have the sum of the angles ACD,
ACB greater than the sum of the angles ABC, ACB;
but the sum of the angles ACD, ACB is two right
angles [xiii.]. Therefore the sum of the angles ABC,
ACB is less than two right angles.

In like manner we may show that the sum of the angles A, B, or of the

angles A, C, is less than two right angles.

Cor. 1.—Every triangle must have at least two acute angles.
Cor. 2.—If two angles of a triangle be unequal, the lesser must be acute.

Prove Prop. xvii. without producing a side.

Exercise.

PROP. XVIII.—Theorem.

If in any triangle (ABC) one side (AC) be greater than another (AB), the

angle opposite to the greater side is grater than the angle opposite to the less.

Dem.—From AC cut oﬀ AD equal to AB
[iii]. Join BD (Post. i.). Now since AB is equal
to AD, the triangle ABD is isosceles; there-
fore [v.] the angle ADB is equal to ABD; but
the angle ADB is greater than the angle ACB
[xvi.]; therefore ABD is greater than ACB.
Much more is the angle ABC greater than the
angle ACB.

20

Or thus: From A as centre, with the lesser
side AB as radius, describe the circle BED,
cutting BC in E. Join AE. Now since AB is
equal to AE, the angle AEB is equal to ABE;
but AEB is greater than ACB (xvi.); therefore
ABE is greater than ACB.

Exercises.

1. If in the second method the circle cut the line CB produced through B, prove the

Proposition.

2. This Proposition may be proved by producing the less side.
3. If two of the opposite sides of a quadrilateral be respectively the greatest and least, the

angles adjacent to the least are greater than their opposite angles.

4. In any triangle, the perpendicular from the vertex opposite the side which is not less

than either of the remaining sides falls within the triangle.

PROP. XIX.—Theorem.

If one angle (B) of a triangle (ABC) be greater than another angle (C), the
side (AC) which it opposite to the greater angle is greater than the side (AB)
which is opposite to the less.

Dem.—If AC be not greater than AB, it must
be either equal to it or less than it. Let us examine
each case:—

1. If AC were equal to AB, the triangle ACB
would be isosceles, and then the angle B would
be equal to C [v.]; but it is not by hypothesis;
therefore AB is not equal to AC.

2. If AC were less than AB, the angle B would

be less than the angle C [xviii.]; but it is not by hypothesis; therefore AC is
not less than AB; and since AC is neither equal to AB nor less than it, it must
be greater.

Exercises.

1. Prove this Proposition by a direct demonstration.
2. A line from the vertex of an isosceles triangle to any point in the base is less than either

of the equal sides, but greater if the point be in the base produced.

3. Three equal lines could not be drawn from the same point to the same line.
4. The perpendicular is the least line which can be drawn from a given point to a given
line; and of all others that may be drawn to it, that which is nearest to the perpendicular is
less than any one more remote.
5. If in the ﬁg., Prop. xvi., AB be the greatest side of the 4 ABC, BF is the greatest
side of the 4 F BC, and the angle BF C is less than half the angle ABC.
6. If ABC be a 4 having AB not greater than AC, a line AG, drawn from A to any point
G in BC, is less than AC. For the angle ACB [xviii.]
is not greater than ABC; but AGC
[xvi.] is greater than ABC; therefore AGC is greater than ACG. Hence AC is greater than
AG.

PROP. XX.—Theorem.

The sum of any two sides (BA, AC) of a triangle (ABC) is greater than the

third.

Dem.—Produce BA to D (Post. ii.),
and make AD equal to AC [iii.]. Join CD.
Then because AD is equal to AC, the angle
ACD is equal to ADC (v.); therefore the
angle BCD is greater than the angle BDC;
hence the side BD opposite to the greater
angle is greater than BC opposite to the
less [xix.]. Again, since AC is equal to AD,
adding BA to both, we have the sum of the
sides BA, AC equal to BD. Therefore the
sum of BA, AC is greater than BC.

Or thus: Bisect the angle BAC by AE [ix.] Then the angle BEA is greater than EAC;
but EAC = EAB (const.); therefore the angle BEA is greater than EAB. Hence AB is
greater than BE [xix.]. In like manner AC is greater than EC. Therefore the sum of BA,
AC is greater than BC.

9. The sum of the three medians of a triangle is less than its perimeter.
10. The sum of the diagonals of a quadrilateral is less than the sum of the lines which can

PROP. XXI.—Theorem.

If two lines (BD, CD) be drawn to a point (D) within a triangle from the
extremities of its base (BC), their sum is less than the sum of the remaining
sides (BA, CA), but they contain a greater angle.

22

Dem.—1. Produce BD (Post. ii.) to meet
AC in E. Then, in the triangle BAE, the sum
of the sides BA, AE is greater than the side BE
[xx.]: to each add EC, and we have the sum
of BA, AC greater than the sum of BE, EC.
Again, the sum of the sides DE, EC of the tri-
angle DEC is greater than DC: to each add BD,
and we get the sum of BE, EC greater than the
sum of BD, DC; but it has been proved that the sum of BA, AC is greater
than the sum of BE, EC. Therefore much more is the sum of BA, AC greater
than the sum of BD, DC.

2. The external angle BDC of the triangle DEC is greater than the internal
angle BEC [xvi.], and the angle BEC, for a like reason, is greater than BAC.
Therefore much more is BDC greater than BAC.

Part 2 may be proved without producing either of the sides BD, DC. Thus:
join AD and produce it to meet BC in F ; then the angle BDF is greater than
the angle BAF [xvi.], and F DC is greater than F AC. Therefore the whole
angle BDC is greater than BAC.

PROP. XXII.—Problem.

To construct a triangle whose three sides shall be respectively equal to three
given lines (A, B, C), the sum of every two of which is greater than the third.
Sol.—Take any right line DE, terminated at D, but unlimited towards E,
and cut oﬀ [iii.] DF equal to A, F G equal to B, and GH equal to C. With F
as centre, and F D as radius, describe the circle KDL (Post. iii.); and with G
as centre, and GH as radius, describe the circle KHL, intersecting the former
circle in K. Join KF , KG. KF G is the triangle required.

23

Dem.—Since F is the centre of the circle KDL, F K is equal to F D; but
F D is equal to A (const.); therefore (Axiom i.) F K is equal to A.
In like
manner GK is equal to C, and F G is equal to B (const.) Hence the three sides
of the triangle KF G are respectively equal to the three lines A, B, C.

EF , and CB equal to F D; then the angle BAC will [viii.] be equal to DEF .
Hence it is the required angle.

PROP. XXIV.—Theorem.

If two triangles (ABC, DEF ) have two sides (AB, AC) of one respectively
equal to two sides (DE, DF ) of the other, but the contained angle (BAC) of
one greater than the contained angle (EDF ) of the other, the base of that which
has the greater angle is greater than the base of the other.

Dem.—Of the two sides AB,
AC, let AB be the one which is not
the greater, and with it make the
angle BAG equal to EDF [xxiii.].
Then because AB is not greater
than AC, AG is less than AC [xix.,
Exer. 6]. Produce AG to H, and
make AH equal to DF or AC [iii.].
Join BH, CH.

In the triangles BAH, EDF , we
have AB equal to DE (hyp.), AH
equal to DF (const.), and the angle
BAH equal to the angle EDF (const.); therefore the base [iv.] BH is equal to
EF . Again, because AH is equal to AC (const.), the triangle ACH is isosceles;
therefore the angle ACH is equal to AHC [v.]; but ACH is greater than BCH;
therefore AHC is greater than BCH: much more is the angle BHC greater than
BCH, and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side [xix.]. Therefore
BC is greater than BH; but BH has been proved to be equal to EF ; therefore
BC is greater than EF .

The concluding part of this Proposition may be proved without joining CH, thus:—

therefore
but
therefore

BG + GH > BH [xx.],
AG + GC > AC [xx.];
BC + AH > BH + AC;
AH = AC (const.);
BC is > BH.

Or thus: Bisect the angle CAH by AO. Join OH. Now in the 4s CAO, HAO we have
the sides CA, AO in one equal to the sides AH, AO in the other, and the contained angles
equal; therefore the base OC is equal to the base OH [iv.]: to each add BO, and we have BC
equal to the sum of BO, OH; but the sum of BO, OH is greater than BH [xx.]. Therefore
BC is greater than BH, that is, greater than EF .

PROP. XXV.—Theorem.

If two triangles (ABC, DEF ) have two sides (AB, AC) of one respectively
equal to two sides (DE, DF ) of the other, but the base (BC) of one greater
than the base (EF ) of the other, the angle (A) contained by the sides of that
which has the greater base is greater them the angle (D) contained by the sides
of the other.

Dem.—If the angle A be not
greater than D, it must be either
equal to it or less than it. We
shall examine each case:—

1. If A were equal to D, the
triangles ABC, DEF would have
the two sides AB, AC of one re-
spectively equal to the two sides
DE, DF of the other, and the an-
gle A contained by the two sides
of one equal to the angle D contained by the two sides of the other. Hence [iv.]
BC would be equal to EF ; but BC is, by hypothesis, greater than EF ; hence
the angle A is not equal to the angle D.

2. If A were less than D, then D would be greater than A, and the triangles
DEF , ABC would have the two sides DE, DF of one respectively equal to the
two sides AB, AC of the other, and the angle D contained by the two sides of
one greater than the angle A contained by the two sides of the other. Hence
[xxiv.] EF would be greater than BC; but EF (hyp.) is not greater than BC.
Therefore A is not less than D, and we have proved that it is not equal to it;
therefore it must be greater.

Or thus, directly: Construct
the triangle ACG, whose three
sides AG, GC, CA shall be re-
spectively equal to the three sides
DE, EF , F D of the triangle
DEF [xxii.]. Join BG. Then
because BC is greater than EF ,
BC is greater than CG. Hence
[xviii.] the angle BGC is greater
than GBC; and make (xxiii.)
the angle BGH equal to GBH, and join AH. Then [vi.] BH is equal to
GH. Therefore the triangles ABH, AGH have the sides AB, AH of one equal
to the sides AG, AH of the other, and the base BH equal to GH. Therefore
[viii.] the angle BAH is equal to GAH. Hence the angle BAC is greater than
CAG, and therefore greater than EDF .

26

Demonstrate this Proposition directly by cutting oﬀ from BC a part equal to EF .

Exercise.

PROP. XXVI.—Theorem.

If two triangles (ABC, DEF ) have two angles (B, C) of one equal respec-
tively to two angles (E, F ) of the other, and a side of one equal to a side
similarly placed with respect to the equal angles of the other, the triangles are
equal in every respect.

Dem.—This Proposition breaks up into two according as the sides given to
be equal are the sides adjacent to the equal angles, namely BC and EF , or
those opposite equal angles.

1. Let the equal sides be BC and EF ;
then if DE be not equal to AB, suppose GE
to be equal to it. Join GF ; then the triangles
ABC, GEF have the sides AB, BC of one
respectively equal to the sides GE, EF of the
other, and the angle ABC equal to the angle
GEF (hyp.); therefore [iv.] the angle ACB is
equal to the angle GF E; but the angle ACB
is (hyp.) equal to DF E; hence GF E is equal
to DF E—a part equal to the whole, which is absurd; therefore AB and DE are
not unequal, that is, they are equal. Consequently the triangles ABC, DEF
have the sides AB, BC of one respectively equal to the sides DE, EF of the
other; and the contained angles ABC and DEF equal; therefore [iv.] AC is
equal to DF , and the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDF .

2. Let the sides given to be equal be
AB and DE; it is required to prove that
BC is equal to EF , and AC to DF . If
BC be not equal to EF , suppose BG to
be equal to it. Join AG. Then the trian-
gles ABG, DEF have the two sides AB,
BG of one respectively equal to the two
sides DE, EF of the other, and the angle
ABG equal to the angle DEF ; therefore
[iv.] the angle AGB is equal to DF E; but the angle ACB is equal to DF E
(hyp.). Hence (Axiom i.) the angle AGB is equal to ACB, that is, the exterior
angle of the triangle ACG is equal to the interior and non-adjacent angle, which
[xvi.] is impossible. Hence BC must be equal to EF , and the same as in 1, AC
is equal to DF , and the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDF .

This Proposition, together with iv. and viii., includes all the cases of the congruence of
two triangles. Part I. may be proved immediately by superposition. For it is evident if ABC
be applied to DEF , so that the point B shall coincide with E, and the line BC with EF ,
since BC is equal to EF , the point C shall coincide with F ; and since the angles B, C are

27

respectively equal to the angles E, F , the lines BA, CA shall coincide with ED and F D.
Hence the triangles are congruent.

Def.—If every point on a geometrical ﬁgure satisﬁes an assigned condition,
that ﬁgure is called the locus of the point satisfying the condition. Thus, for
example, a circle is the locus of a point whose distance from the centre is equal
to its radius.

Exercises.

7. The bisectors of the three internal angles of a triangle are concurrent.
8. The bisectors of two external angles and the bisector of the third internal angle are

Parallel Lines.

Def. i.—If two right lines in the same plane be such that, when produced
indeﬁnitely, they do not meet at any ﬁnite distance, they are said to be paral-
lel.

Def. ii.—A parallelogram is a quadrilateral, both pairs of whose opposite

called a trapezium.

Def. vi.—If from the extremities of one right
line perpendiculars be drawn to another, the inter-
cept between their feet is called the projection of the
ﬁrst line on the second.

Def. vii.—When a right line intersects two
other right lines in two distinct points it makes
with them eight angles, which have received spe-
cial names in relation to one another. Thus, in the

28

sides are parallel.

lateral is called a diagonal.

Def. iii.—The right line joining either pair of opposite angles of a quadri-

Def. iv.—If both pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral be produced to
meet, the right line joining their points of intersection is called its third diagonal.
Def. v.—A quadrilateral which has one pair of opposite sides parallel is

ﬁgure—1, 2; 7, 8 are called exterior angles; 3, 4; 5, 6, interior angles. Again,
4; 6; 3, 5 are called alternate angles; lastly, 1, 5; 2, 6; 3, 8; 4, 7 are called
corresponding angles.

PROP. XXVII.—Theorem.

If a right line (EF ) intersecting two right lines (AB, CD) makes the alternate

angles (AEF, EF D) equal to each other, these lines are parallel.

Dem.—If AB and CD are not paral-
lel they must meet, if produced, at some
ﬁnite distance: if possible let them meet
in G; then the ﬁgure EGF is a triangle,
and the angle AEF is an exterior angle,
and EF D a non-adjacent interior angle.
Hence [xvi.] AEF is greater than EF D;
but it is also equal to it (hyp.), that is, both equal and greater, which is absurd.
Hence AB and CD are parallel.

Or thus: Bisect EF in O; turn the whole ﬁgure round O as a centre, so that
EF shall fall on itself; then because OE = OF , the point E shall fall on F ; and
because the angle AEF is equal to the angle EF D, the line EA will occupy
the place of F D, and the line F D the place of EA; therefore the lines AB, CD
interchange places, and the ﬁgure is symmetrical with respect to the point O.
Hence, if AB, CD meet on one side of O, they must also meet on the other
side; but two right lines cannot enclose a space (Axiom x.); therefore they do
not meet at either side. Hence they are parallel.

PROP. XXVIII.—Theorem.

If a right line (EF ) intersecting two right lines (AB, CD) makes the exterior
angle (EGB) equal to its corresponding interior angle (GHD), or makes two
interior angles (BGH, GHD) on the same side equal to two right angles, the
two right lines are parallel.

Dem.—1. Since the lines AB, EF inter-
sect, the angle AGH is equal to EGB [xv.];
but EGB is equal to GHD (hyp.); therefore
AGH is equal to GHD, and they are alternate
angles. Hence [xxvii.] AB is parallel to CD.
2. Since AGH and BGH are adjacent an-
gles, their sum is equal to two right angles
[xiii.]; but the sum of BGH and GHD is two
right angles (hyp.); therefore rejecting the angle BGH we have AGH equal
GHD, and they are alternate angles; therefore AB is parallel to CD [xxvii.].

29

PROP. XXIX.—Theorem.

If a right line (EF ) intersect two parallel right lines (AB, CD), it makes—
1. the alternate angles (AGH, GHD) equal to one another; 2. the exterior angle
(EGB) equal to the corresponding interior angle (GHD); 3. the two interior
angles (BGH, GHD) on the same side equal to two right angles.

Dem.—If the angle AGH be not equal to
GHD, one must be greater than the other. Let
AGH be the greater; to each add BGH, and
we have the sum of the angles AGH, BGH
greater than the sum of the angles BGH,
GHD; but the sum of AGH, BGH is two right
angles; therefore the sum of BGH, GHD is
less than two right angles, and therefore (Ax-
iom xii.) the lines AB, CD, if produced, will meet at some ﬁnite distance: but
since they are parallel (hyp.) they cannot meet at any ﬁnite distance. Hence
the angle AGH is not unequal to GHD—that is, it is equal to it.

2. Since the angle EGB is equal to AGH [xv.], and GHD is equal to AGH

(1), EGB is equal to GHD (Axiom i.).

3. Since AGH is equal to GHD (1), add HGB to each, and we have the sum
of the angles AGH, HGB equal to the sum of the angles GHD, HGB; but the
sum of the angles AGH, HGB [xiii.] is two right angles; therefore the sum of
the angles BGH, GHD is two right angles.

Exercises.

1. Demonstrate both parts of Prop. xxviii. without using Prop. xxvii.
2. The parts of all perpendiculars to two parallel lines intercepted between them are equal.
3. If ACD, BCD be adjacent angles, any parallel to AB will meet the bisectors of these

4. If through the middle point O of any right line terminated by two parallel right lines

portions on the parallels.

6. The perimeter of the parallelogram, formed by drawing parallels to two sides of an

equilateral triangle from any point in the third side, is equal to twice the side.

7. If the opposite sides of a hexagon be equal and parallel, its diagonals are concurrent.
8. If two intersecting right lines be respectively parallel to two others, the angle between
the former is equal to the angle between the latter. For if AB, AC be respectively parallel to
DE, DF , and if AC, DE meet in G, the angles A, D are each equal to G [xxix.].

PROP. XXX.—Theorem.

If two right lines (AB, CD) be parallel to the same right line (EF ), they are

30

Dem.—Draw any secant GHK. Then since
AB and EF are parallel, the angle AGH is equal
to GHF [xxix.]. In like manner the angle GHF
is equal to HKD [xxix.]. Therefore the angle
AGK is equal to the angle GKD (Axiom i.).
Hence [xxvii.] AB is parallel to CD.

that there are two solutions in each case.

PROP. XXXII.—Theorem.

If any side (AB) of a triangle (ABC) be
produced (to D), the external angle (CBD)
is equal to the sum of the two internal non-
adjacent angles (A, C), and the sum of the
three internal angles is equal to two right an-
gles.

Dem.—Draw BE parallel to AC [xxxi.].
Now since BC intersects the parallels BE,
AC, the alternate angles EBC, ACB are
equal [xxix.]. Again, since AB intersects the parallels BE, AC, the angle
EBD is equal to BAC [xxix.]; hence the whole angle CBD is equal to the sum

31

of the two angles ACB, BAC: to each of these add the angle ABC and we
have the sum of CBD, ABC equal to the sum of the three angles ACB, BAC,
ABC: but the sum of CBD, ABC is two right angles [xiii.]; hence the sum of
the three angles ACB, BAC, ABC is two right angles.

Cor. 1.—If a right-angled triangle be isosceles, each base angle is half a right

PROP. XXXIII.—Theorem.

The right lines (AC, BD) which join the adjacent extremities of two equal and

parallel right lines (AB, CD) are equal and parallel.

Dem.—Join BC. Now since AB is paral-
lel to CD, and BC intersects them, the an-
gle ABC is equal to the alternate angle DCB
[xxix.]. Again, since AB is equal to CD, and
BC common, the triangles ABC, DCB have
the sides AB, BC in one respectively equal to
the sides DC, CB in the other, and the angles
ABC, DCB contained by those sides equal;
therefore [iv.] the base AC is equal to the base
BD, and the angle ACB is equal to the angle CBD; but these are alternate
angles; hence [xxvii.] AC is parallel to BD, and it has been proved equal to it.
Therefore AC is both equal and parallel to BD.

PROP. XXXIV.—Theorem.

The opposite sides (AB, CD; AC, BD) and the opposite angles (A, D;
B, C) of a parallelogram are equal to one another, and either diagonal bisects
the parallelogram.

Dem.—Join BC. Since AB is parallel to
CD, and BC intersects them, the angle ABC
is equal to the angle BCD [xxix.]. Again,
since BC intersects the parallels AC, BD, the
angle ACB is equal to the angle CBD; hence
the triangles ABC, DCB have the two angles
ABC, ACB in one respectively equal to the
two angles BCD, CBD in the other, and the
side BC common. Therefore [xxvi.] AB is equal to CD, and AC to BD; the
angle BAC to the angle BDC, and the triangle ABC to the triangle BDC.

Again, because the angle ACB is equal to CBD, and DCB equal to ABC,

the whole angle ACD is equal to the whole angle ABD.

PROP. XXXV.—Theorem.

Parallelograms on the same base (BC) and between the same parallels are

equal.

Dem.—1. Let the sides AD, DF
of the parallelograms AC, BF op-
posite to the common base BC ter-
minate in the same point D, then
[xxxiv.] each parallelogram is dou-
ble of the triangle BCD. Hence they
are equal to one another.

2. Let the sides AD, EF (ﬁgures

(α), (β)) opposite to BC not terminate in the same point.

34

Then because ABCD is a parallelogram, AD is equal to BC [xxxiv.]; and
since BCEF is a parallelogram, EF is equal to BC; therefore (see ﬁg. (α))
take away ED, and in ﬁg. (β) add ED, and we have in each case AE equal to
DF , and BA is equal to CD [xxxiv.]. Hence the triangles BAE, CDF have
the two sides BA, AE in one respectively equal to the two sides CD, DF in
the other, and the angle BAE [xxix.] equal to the angle CDF ; hence [iv.] the
triangle BAE is equal to the triangle CDF ; and taking each of these triangles
in succession from the quadrilateral BAF C, there will remain the parallelogram
BCF E equal to the parallelogram BCDA.

Or thus: The triangles ABE, DCF have [xxxiv.] the sides AB, BE in
one respectively equal to the sides DC, CF in the other, and the angle ABE
equal to the angle DCF [xxix., Ex. 8]. Hence the triangle ABE is equal to the
triangle DCF ; and, taking each away from the quadrilateral BAF C, there will
remain the parallelogram BCF E equal to the parallelogram BCDA.

Observation.—By the second method of proof the subdivision of the demonstration into
cases is avoided. It is easy to see that either of the two parallelograms ABCD, EBCF can be
divided into parts and rearranged so as to make it congruent with the other. This Proposition
aﬀords the ﬁrst instance in the Elements in which equality which is not congruence occurs.
This equality is expressed algebraically by the symbol =, while congruence is denoted by ≡,
called also the symbol of identity. Figures that are congruent are said to be identically equal.

PROP. XXXVI.—Theorem.

Parallelograms (BD, F H) on equal bases (BC, F G) and between the same

parallels are equal.

Dem.—Join BE, CH. Now
since F H is a parallelogram, F G
is equal to EH [xxxiv.]; but BC
is equal to F G (hyp.); therefore
BC is equal to EH (Axiom i.).
Hence BE, CH, which join their
adjacent extremities, are equal
and parallel; therefore BH is a
parallelogram. Again, since the parallelograms BD, BH are on the same base
BC, and between the same parallels BC, AH, they are equal [xxxv.]. In like
manner, since the parallelograms HB, HF are on the same base EH, and be-
tween the same parallels EH, BG, they are equal. Hence BD and F H are each
equal to BH. Therefore (Axiom i.) BD is equal to F H.

35

Exercise.—Prove this Proposition without joining BE, CH.

PROP. XXXVII.—Theorem.

Triangles (ABC, DBC) on the same base (BC) and between the same

parallels (AD, BC) are equal.

Dem.—Produce AD both
Draw BE parallel to
ways.
AC, and CF parallel to BD
[xxxi.] Then the ﬁgures AEBC,
DBCF are parallelograms; and
since they are on the same base
BC, and between the same par-
allels BC, EF they are equal
[xxxv.]. Again, the triangle ABC is half the parallelogram AEBC [xxxiv.],
because the diagonal AB bisects it. In like manner the triangle DBC is half
the parallelogram DBCF , because the diagonal DC bisects it, and halves of
equal things are equal (Axiom vii.). Therefore the triangle ABC is equal to the
triangle DBC.

Exercises.

1. If two equal triangles be on the same base, but on opposite sides, the right line joining

their vertices is bisected by the base.

2. Construct a triangle equal in area to a given quadrilateral ﬁgure.
3. Construct a triangle equal in area to a given rectilineal ﬁgure.
4. Construct a lozenge equal to a given parallelogram, and having a given side of the

parallelogram for base.

5. Given the base and the area of a triangle, ﬁnd the locus of the vertex.
6. If through a point O, in the production of the diagonal AC of a parallelogram ABCD,
any right line be drawn cutting the sides AB, BC in the points E, F , and ED, F D be joined,
the triangle EF D is less than half the parallelogram.

PROP. XXXVIII.—Theorem.

Two triangles on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal.

Dem.—By a construction similar to the last, we see that the triangles are
the halves of parallelograms, on equal bases, and between the same parallels.
Hence they are the halves of equal parallelograms [xxxvi.]. Therefore they are
equal to one another.

Exercises.

1. Every median of a triangle bisects the triangle.
2. If two triangles have two sides of one respectively equal to two sides of the other, and

the contained angles supplemental, their areas are equal.

36

3. If the base of a triangle be divided into any number of equal parts, right lines drawn
from the vertex to the points of division will divide the whole triangle into as many equal
parts.

4. Right lines from any point in the diagonal of a parallelogram to the angular points
through which the diagonal does not pass, and the diagonal, divide the parallelogram into
four triangles which are equal, two by two.

conversely.

5. If one diagonal of a quadrilateral bisects the other, it also bisects the quadrilateral, and
6. If two 4s ABC, ABD be on the same base AB, and between the same parallels, and
if a parallel to AB meet the sides AC, BC in the point E, F ; and the sides AD, BD in the
point G, H; then EF = GH.

7. If instead of triangles on the same base we have triangles on equal bases and between
the same parallels, the intercepts made by the sides of the triangles on any parallel to the
bases are equal.

8. If the middle points of any two sides of a triangle be joined, the triangle so formed with

the two half sides is one-fourth of the whole.

9. The triangle whose vertices are the middle points of two sides, and any point in the

base of another triangle, is one-fourth of that triangle.

10. Bisect a given triangle by a right line drawn from a given point in one of the sides.
11. Trisect a given triangle by three right lines drawn from a given point within it.
12. Prove that any right line through the intersection of the diagonals of a parallelogram

bisects the parallelogram.

13. The triangle formed by joining the middle point of one of the non-parallel sides of a

trapezium to the extremities of the opposite side is equal to half the trapezium.

PROP. XXXIX.—Theorem.

Equal triangles (BAC, BDC) on the same base (BC) and on the same side of

it are between the same parallels.

Dem.—Join AD. Then if AD be not par-
allel to BC, let AE be parallel to it, and let
it cut BD in E. Join EC. Now since the tri-
angles BEC, BAC are on the same base BC,
and between the same parallels BC, AE, they
are equal [xxxvii.]; but the triangle BAC is
equal to the triangle BDC (hyp.). Therefore
(Axiom i.)
the triangle BEC is equal to the
triangle BDC—that is, a part equal to the whole which is absurd. Hence AD
must be parallel to BC.

PROP. XL.—Theorem.

Equal triangles (ABC, DEF ) on equal bases (BC, EF ) which form parts
of the same right line, and on the same side of the line, are between the same
parallels.

37

Dem.—Join AD.

If AD be not
parallel to BF ,
let AG be parallel
to it. Join GF . Now since the tri-
angles GEF and ABC are on equal
bases BC, EF , and between the same
parallels BF , AG,
they are equal
[xxxviii.]; but the triangle DEF is
equal to the triangle ABC (hyp.). Hence GEF is equal to DEF (Axiom i.)—
that is, a part equal to the whole, which is absurd. Therefore AD must be
parallel to BF .

Def.—The altitude of a triangle is the perpendicular from the vertex on the

base.

Exercises.

1. Triangles and parallelograms of equal bases and altitudes are respectively equal.
2. The right line joining the middle points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the
third; for the medians from the extremities of the base to these points will each bisect the
original triangle. Hence the two triangles whose base is the third side and whose vertices are
the points of bisection are equal.

3. The parallel to any side of a triangle through the middle point of another bisects the

third.

4. The lines of connexion of the middle points of the sides of a triangle divide it into four

congruent triangles.

8. The parallelogram formed by the line of connexion of the middle points of two sides of

9. The right line joining the middle points of opposite sides of a quadrilateral, and the

right line joining the middle points of its diagonals, are concurrent.

PROP. XLI.—Theorem.

If a parallelogram (ABCD) and a triangle (EBC) be on the same base (BC)

and between the same parallels, the parallelogram is double of the triangle.

Dem.—Join AC.

The parallelogram
ABCD is double of the triangle ABC [xxxiv.];
but the triangle ABC is equal to the trian-
gle EBC [xxxvii.]. Therefore the parallelogram
ABCD is double of the triangle EBC.

Cor. 1.—If a triangle and a parallelogram
have equal altitudes, and if the base of the tri-
angle be double of the base of the parallelogram,
the areas are equal.

38

Cor. 2.—The sum of the triangles whose bases are two opposite sides of
a parallelogram, and which have any point between these sides as a common
vertex, is equal to half the parallelogram.

PROP. XLII.—Problem.

To construct a parallelogram equal to a given triangle (ABC), and having an

angle equal to a given angle (D).

Sol.—Bisect AB in E. Join EC. Make the angle BEF [xxiii.] equal to D.
Draw CG parallel to AB [xxxi.], and BG parallel to EF . EG is a parallelogram
fulﬁlling the required conditions.

Dem.—Because AE is equal to EB (const.), the triangle AEC is equal
to the triangle EBC [xxxviii.], therefore the triangle ABC is double of the
triangle EBC; but the parallelogram EG is also double of the triangle EBC
[xli.], because they are on the same base EB, and between the same parallels
EB and CG. Therefore the parallelogram EG is equal to the triangle ABC,
and it has (const.) the angle BEF equal to D. Hence EG is a parallelogram
fulﬁlling the required conditions.

PROP. XLIII.—Theorem.

The parallels (EF, GH) through any
point (K) in one of the diagonals (AC) of
a parallelogram divide it into four parallelo-
grams, of which the two (BK, KD) through
which the diagonal does not pass, and which
are called the complements of the other
two, are equal.

Dem.—Because the diagonal bisects the

parallelograms AC, AK, KC we have [xxxiv.] the triangle ADC equal to the
triangle ABC, the triangle AHK equal to AEK, and the triangle KF C equal
to the triangle KGC. Hence, subtracting the sums of the two last equalities
from the ﬁrst, we get the parallelogram DK equal to the parallelogram KB.

Cor. 1.—If through a point K within a parallelogram ABCD lines drawn
parallel to the sides make the parallelograms DK, KB equal, K is a point in
the diagonal AC.

Cor. 2.—The parallelogram BH is equal to AF , and BF to HC.
Cor. 2. supplies an easy demonstration of a fundamental Proposition in Statics.

Exercises.

1. If EF , GH be parallels to the adja-
cent sides of a parallelogram ABCD, the di-
s into
agonals EH, GF of two of the four
which they divide it and one of the diagonals
of ABCD are concurrent.

Dem.—Let EH, GF meet

in M ;
through M draw M P , M J parallel to AB,
BC. Produce AD, GH, BC to meet M P ,
and AB, EF , DC to meet M J. Now the
complement OF = F J:
to each add the
CJ.
Again, the complement P H = HK [xliii.]:
to each add the
OC, and we get the

F L, and we get the ﬁgure OF L =

P C = ﬁgure OF L. Hence the

P C = CJ. Therefore they are about the same di-

agonal [xliii., Cor. 1]. Hence AC produced will pass through M .

2. The middle points of the three diagonals AC, BD, EF of a quadrilateral ABCD are

collinear.

Dem.—Complete the

AEBG. Draw DH, CI parallel to AG, BG. Join IH, and
produce; then AB, CD, IH are concurrent (Ex. 1); therefore IH will pass through F . Join
EI, EH. Now [xi., Ex. 2, 3] the middle points of EI, EH, EF are collinear, but [xxxiv.,
Ex. 1] the middle points of EI, EH are the middle points of AC, BD. Hence the middle
points of AC, BD, EF are collinear.

PROP. XLIV.—Problem.

To a given, right line (AB) to apply a parallelogram which shall be equal to

a given triangle (C), and have one of its angles equal to a given angle (D).

40

Sol.—Construct the parallelogram BEF G [xlii.] equal to the given triangle
C, and having the angle B equal to the given angle D, and so that its side BE
shall be in the same right line with AB. Through A draw AH parallel to BG
[xxxi.], and produce F G to meet it in H. Join HB. Then because HA and F E
are parallels, and HF intersects them, the sum of the angles AHF , HF E is two
right angles [xxix.]; therefore the sum of the angles BHF , HF E is less than
two right angles; and therefore (Axiom xii.) the lines HB, F E, if produced,
will meet as at K. Through K draw KL parallel to AB [xxxi.], and produce
HA and GB to meet it in the points L and M. Then AM is a parallelogram
fulﬁlling the required conditions.

Dem.—The parallelogram AM is equal to GE [xliii.]; but GE is equal to
the triangle C (const.); therefore AM is equal to the triangle C. Again, the
angle ABM is equal to EBG [xv.], and EBG is equal to D (const.); therefore
the angle ABM is equal to D; and AM is constructed on the given line; therefore
it is the parallelogram required.

PROP. XLV.—Problem.

To construct a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal ﬁgure (ABCD), and

having an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle (X).

Sol.—Join BD. Construct a parallelogram EG [xlii.] equal to the triangle
ABD, and having the angle E equal to the given angle X; and to the right line
GH apply the parallelogram HI equal to the triangle BCD, and having the
angle GHK equal to X [xliv.], and so on for additional triangles if there be
any. Then EI is a parallelogram fulﬁlling the required conditions.

41

Dem.—Because the angles GHK, F EH are each equal to X (const.), they
are equal to one another: to each add the angle GHE, and we have the sum
of the angles GHK, GHE equal to the sum of the angles F EH, GHE; but
since HG is parallel to EF , and EH intersects them, the sum of F EH, GHE
is two right angles [xxix.]. Hence the sum of GHK, GHE is two right angles;
therefore EH, HK are in the same right line [xiv.].

Again, because GH intersects the parallels F G, EK, the alternate angles
F GH, GHK are equal [xxix.]: to each add the angle HGI, and we have the
sum of the angles F GH, HGI equal to the sum of the angles GHK, HGI; but
since GI is parallel to HK, and GH intersects them, the sum of the angles
GHK, HGI is equal to two right angles [xxix.]. Hence the sum of the angles
F GH, HGI is two right angles; therefore F G and GI are in the same right line
[xiv.].

Again, because EG and HI are parallelograms, EF and KI are each parallel
to GH; hence [xxx.] EF is parallel to KI, and the opposite sides EK and F I
are parallel; therefore EI is a parallelogram; and because the parallelogram EG
(const.) is equal to the triangle ABD, and HI to the triangle BCD, the whole
parallelogram EI is equal to the rectilineal ﬁgure ABCD, and it has the angle
E equal to the given angle X. Hence EI is a parallelogram fulﬁlling the required
conditions.

It would simplify Problems xliv., xlv., if they were stated as the constructing of rectan-
gles, and in this special form they would be better understood by the student, since rectangles
are the simplest areas to which others are referred.

Exercises.

1. Construct a rectangle equal to the sum of two or any number of rectilineal ﬁgures.
2. Construct a rectangle equal to the diﬀerence of two given ﬁgures.

PROP. XLVI.—Problem.

On a given right line (AB) to describe a square.

Sol.—Erect AD at right angles to AB [xi.], and make
it equal to AB [iii.]. Through D draw DC parallel to AB
[xxxi.], and through B draw BC parallel to AD; then
AC is the square required.

Dem.—Because AC is a parallelogram, AB is equal
to CD [xxxiv.]; but AB is equal to AD (const.); there-
fore AD is equal to CD, and AD is equal to BC [xxxiv.].
Hence the four sides are equal; therefore AC is a lozenge,
and the angle A is a right angle. Therefore AC is a
square (Def. xxx.).

42

Exercises.

1. The squares on equal lines are equal; and, conversely, the sides of equal squares are

equal.

2. The parallelograms about the diagonal of a square are squares.
3. If on the four sides of a square, or on the sides produced, points be taken equidistant
from the four angles, they will be the angular points of another square, and similarly for a
regular pentagon, hexagon, &c.

4. Divide a given square into ﬁve equal parts; namely, four right-angled triangles, and a

square.

PROP. XLVII.—Theorem.

In a right-angled triangle (ABC) the square on the hypotenuse (AB) is equal

to the sum of the squares on the other two sides (AC, BC).

Dem.—On the sides AB, BC,
CA describe squares [xlvi.]. Draw
CL parallel to AG. Join CG, BK.
Then because the angle ACB is right
(hyp.), and ACH is right, being the
angle of a square, the sum of the an-
gles ACB, ACH is two right angles;
therefore BC, CH are in the same
right line [xiv.]. In like manner AC,
CD are in the same right line. Again,
because BAG is the angle of a square
it is a right angle:
in like manner
CAK is a right angle. Hence BAG
is equal to CAK: to each add BAC,
and we get the angle CAG equal to
KAB. Again, since BG and CK are squares, BA is equal to AG, and CA to
AK. Hence the two triangles CAG, KAB have the sides CA, AG in one respec-
tively equal to the sides KA, AB in the other, and the contained angles CAG,
KAB also equal. Therefore [iv.] the triangles are equal; but the parallelogram
AL is double of the triangle CAG [xli.], because they are on the same base AG,
and between the same parallels AG and CL. In like manner the parallelogram
AH is double of the triangle KAB, because they are on the same base AK, and
between the same parallels AK and BH; and since doubles of equal things are
equal (Axiom vi.), the parallelogram AL is equal to AH. In like manner it can
be proved that the parallelogram BL is equal to BD. Hence the whole square
AF is equal to the sum of the two squares AH and BD.

43

Or thus: Let all the squares be made in reversed di-
rections. Join CG, BK, and through C draw OL parallel
to AG. Now, taking the ∠BAC from the right ∠s BAG,
CAK, the remaining ∠s CAG, BAK are equal. Hence the
4s CAG, BAK have the side CA = AK, and AG = AB,
and the ∠CAG = BAK; therefore [iv.] they are equal; and
since [xli.] the
s AL, AH are respectively the doubles of
these triangles, they are equal. In like manner the
s BL,
BD are equal; hence the whole square AF is equal to the
sum of the two squares AH, BD.

This proof is shorter than the usual one, since it is not
necessary to prove that AC, CD are in one right line. In a
similar way the Proposition may be proved by taking any of
the eight ﬁgures formed by turning the squares in all possible
directions. Another simpliﬁcation of the proof would be got
by considering that the point A is such that one of the 4s CAG, BAK can be turned round
it in its own plane until it coincides with the other; and hence that they are congruent.

8. The square described on the sum of the sides of a right-angled triangle exceeds the
square on the hypotenuse by four times the area of the triangle (see ﬁg., xlvi., Ex. 3). More
generally, if the vertical angle of a triangle be equal to the angle of a regular polygon of n
sides, then the regular polygon of n sides, described on a line equal to the sum of its sides,
exceeds the area of the regular polygon of n sides described on the base by n times the area
of the triangle.

9. If AC and BK intersect in P , and through P a line be drawn parallel to BC, meeting

14. In an equilateral triangle, three times the square on any side is equal to four times the

square on the perpendicular to it from the opposite vertex.

15. On BE, a part of the side BC of a square ABCD, is described the square BEF G,
having its side BG in the continuation of AB; it is required to divide the ﬁgure AGF ECD
into three parts which will form a square.

16. Four times the sum of the squares on the medians which bisect the sides of a right-

angled triangle is equal to ﬁve times the square on the hypotenuse.

17. If perpendiculars be let fall on the sides of a polygon from any point, dividing each

the sum of the squares on the remaining set.

18. The sum of the squares on lines drawn from any point to one pair of opposite angles

sides; prove that the sum of the rectangles contained by the sides and their lower segments is
equal to the square on the base.

PROP. XLVIII.—Theorem.

If the square on one side (AB) of a triangle be equal to the sum of the squares
on the remaining sides (AC, CB), the angle (C) opposite to that side is a right
angle.

Dem.—Erect CD at right angles to CB [xi.], and
make CD equal to CA [iii.]. Join BD. Then because
AC is equal to CD, the square on AC is equal to the
square on CD: to each add the square on CB, and
we have the sum of the squares on AC, CB equal
to the sum of the squares on CD, CB; but the sum
of the squares on AC, CB is equal to the square on
AB (hyp.), and the sum of the squares on CD, CB
is equal to the square on BD [xlvii.]. Therefore the
square on AB is equal to the square on BD. Hence AB is equal to BD [xlvi.,
Ex. 1]. Again, because AC is equal to CD (const.), and CB common to the
two triangles ACB, DCB, and the base AB equal to the base DB, the angle
ACB is equal to the angle DCB; but the angle DCB is a right angle (const.).
Hence the angle ACB is a right angle.

The foregoing proof forms an exception to Euclid’s
demonstrations of converse propositions, for it is direct.
The following is an indirect proof:—If CB be not at right
angles to AC, let CD be perpendicular to it. Make CD =
CB. Join AD. Then, as before, it can be proved that AD
is equal to AB, and CD is equal to CB (const.). This is
contrary to Prop. vii. Hence the angle ACB is a right
angle.

BOOK II.

THEORY OF RECTANGLES

Every Proposition in the Second Book has either a square or a rectangle in
its enunciation. Before commencing it the student should read the following
preliminary explanations: by their assistance it will be seen that this Book,
which is usually considered diﬃcult, will be rendered not only easy, but almost
intuitively evident.

1. As the linear unit is that by which we express all linear measures, so the square unit is
that to which all superﬁcial measures are referred. Again, as there are diﬀerent linear units
in use, such as in this country, inches, feet, yards, miles, &c., and in France, metres, and their
multiples or sub-multiples, so diﬀerent square units are employed.

2. A square unit is the square described on a line whose length is the linear unit. Thus
a square inch is the square described on a line whose length is an inch; a square foot is the
square described on a line whose length is a foot, &c.

3. If we take a linear foot, describe a square on it, divide two adjacent sides each into
twelve equal parts, and draw parallels to the sides, we evidently divide the square foot into
square inches; and as there will manifestly be 12 rectangular parallelograms, each containing
12 square inches, the square foot contains 144 square inches.

In the same manner it can be shown that a square yard contains 9 square feet; and so in
general the square described on any line contains n2 times the square described on the nth
part of the line. Thus, as a simple case, the square on a line is four times the square on its
half. On account of this property the second power of a quantity is called its square; and,
conversely, the square on a line AB is expressed symbolically by AB2.

4. If a rectangular parallelogram be such that two adjacent sides contain respectively m
and n linear units, by dividing one side into m and the other into n equal parts, and drawing
parallels to the sides, the whole area is evidently divided into mn square units. Hence the area
of the parallelogram is found by multiplying its length by its breadth, and this explains why
we say (see Def. iv.) a rectangle is contained by any two adjacent sides; for if we multiply the
length of one by the length of the other we have the area. Thus, if AB, AD be two adjacent
sides of a rectangle, the rectangle is expressed by AB . AD.

Definitions.

i.

If a point C be taken in a line AB, the
parts AC, CB are called segments, and C a point
of division.

ii. If C be taken in the line AB produced,
AC, CB are still called the segments of the
line AB; but C is called a point of external division.

iii. A parallelogram whose angles are right angles is called a rectangle.
iv. A rectangle is said to be contained by
any two adjacent sides. Thus the rectangle
ABCD is said to be contained by AB, AD, or
by AB, BC, &c.

v. The rectangle contained by two sepa-
rate lines such as AB and CD is the parallel-
ogram formed by erecting a perpendicular to

49

AB, at A, equal to CD, and drawing parallels:
the area of the rectangle will be AB . CD.

vi. In any parallelogram the ﬁgure which
is composed of either of the parallelograms
about a diagonal and the two complements
[see I., xliii.] is called a gnomon. Thus, if we
take away either of the parallelograms AO,
OC from the parallelogram AC, the remain-
der is called a gnomon.

PROP. I.—Theorem.

If there be two lines (A, BC), one of which is divided into any number of
parts (BD, DE, EC), the rectangle contained by the two lines (A, BC), is
equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by the undivided line (A) and the
several parts of the divided line.

Dem.—Erect BF at right an-
gles to BC [I., xi.] and make it
equal to A. Complete the parallel-
ogram BK (Def. v.). Through D,
E draw DG, EH parallel to BF .
Because the angles at B, D, E are
right angles, each of the quadrilat-
erals BG, DH, EK is a rectangle.
Again, since A is equal to BF (const.), the rectangle contained by A and BC
is the rectangle contained by BF and BC (Def. v.); but BK is the rectangle
contained by BF and BC. Hence the rectangle contained by A and BC is BK.
In like manner the rectangle contained by A and BD is BG. Again, since A is
equal to BF (const.), and BF is equal to DG [I. xxxiv.], A is equal to DG.
Hence the rectangle contained by A and DE is the ﬁgure DH (Def. v.). In like
manner the rectangle contained by A and EC is the ﬁgure EK. Hence we have
the following identities:—

Rectangle contained by A and BD ≡ BG.
A ,, DE ≡ DH.
A ,, EC ≡ EK.
A ,, BC ≡ BK.

,,
,,
,,

,,
,,
,,

But BK is equal to the sum of BG, DH, EK (I., Axiom ix.). Therefore the
rectangle contained by A and BC is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained
by A and BD, A and DE, A and EC.

If we denote the lines BD, DE, EC by a, b, c, the Proposition asserts that the rectangle
contained by A, and a + b + c is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by A and a, A

50

and b, A and c, or, as it may be written, A(a + b + c) = Aa + Ab + Ac. This corresponds to
the distributive law in multiplication, and shows that rectangles in Geometry, and products
in Arithmetic and Algebra, are subject to the same rules.

Illustration.—Suppose A to be 6 inches; BD, 5 inches; DE, 4 inches; EC, 3 inches; then

BC will be 12 inches; and the rectangles will have the following values:—

Rectangle A . BC = 6 × 12 = 72 square inches.

,,
,,
,,

A . BD = 6 × 5 = 30
A . DE = 6 × 4 = 24
A . EC = 6 × 3 = 18

,,
,,
,,

Now the sum of the three last rectangles, viz. 30, 24, 18, is 72. Hence the rectangle

A . BC = A . BD + A . DE + A . EC.

The Second Book is occupied with the relations between the segments of a
line divided in various ways. All these can be proved in the most simple man-
ner by Algebraic Multiplication. We recommend the student to make himself
acquainted with the proofs by this method as well as with those of Euclid. He
will thus better understand the meaning of each Proposition.

Cor. 1.—The rectangle contained by a line and the diﬀerence of two others
is equal to the diﬀerence of the rectangles contained by the line and each of the
others.

Cor. 2.—The area of a triangle is equal to half the rectangle contained by its

base and perpendicular.

Dem.—From the vertex C let fall the per-
pendicular CD. Draw EF parallel to AB, and
AE, BF each parallel to CD. Then AF is the
rectangle contained by AB and BF ; but BF is
equal to CD. Hence AF = AB . CD; but [I. xli.]
the triangle ABC is = half the parallelogram AF .
Therefore the triangle ABC is = 1

2 AB . CD.

PROP. II.—Theorem.

If a line (AB) be divided into any two parts (at C), the square on the whole
line is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by the whole and each of the
segments (AC, CB).

the

Dem.—On AB describe

square ABDF
[I. xlvi.], and through C draw CE parallel to AF
[I. xxxi.]. Now, since AB is equal to AF , the rectan-
gle contained by AB and AC is equal to the rectangle
contained by AF and AC; but AE is the rectangle
contained by AF and AC. Hence the rectangle con-
tained by AB and AC is equal to AE. In like manner
the rectangle contained by AB and CB is equal to the
ﬁgure CD. Therefore the sum of the two rectangles
AB . AC, AB . CB is equal to the square on AB.

Or thus:

and

Hence, multiplying, we get

AB = AC + CB,

AB = AB.
AB2 = AB . AC + AB . CB.

51

This Proposition is the particular case of i. when the divided and undivided lines are

equal, hence it does not require a separate Demonstration.

PROP. III.—Theorem.

If a line (AB) be divided into two segments (at C), the rectangle contained
by the whole line and either segment (CB) is equal to the square on that segment
together with the rectangle contained by the segments.

Dem.—On BC describe the square BCDE
[I. xlvi.]. Through A draw AF parallel to CD:
produce ED to meet AF in F . Now since CB
is equal to CD, the rectangle contained by AC,
CB is equal to the rectangle contained by AC,
CD; but the rectangle contained by AC, CD is
the ﬁgure AD. Hence the rectangle AC . CB is equal to the ﬁgure AD, and the
square on CB is the ﬁgure CE. Hence the rectangle AC . CB, together with
the square on CB, is equal to the ﬁgure AE.

Again, since CB is equal to BE, the rectangle AB . CB is equal to the
rectangle AB . BE; but the rectangle AB . BE is equal to the ﬁgure AE. Hence
the rectangle AB . CB is equal to the ﬁgure AE. And since things which are
equal to the same are equal to one another, the rectangle AC . CB, together with
the square on CB, is equal to the rectangle AB . CB.

Or thus:

AB = AC + CB,

CB = CB.

Hence

AB . CB = AC . CB + CB2.

Prop. iii. is the particular case of Prop. i., when the undivided line is equal to a segment

of the divided line.

PROP. IV.—Theorem.

If a line (AB) be divided into any two parts (at C), the square on the whole
line is equal to the sum of the squares on the parts (AC, CB), together with
twice their rectangle.

Dem.—On AB describe a square ABDE. Join
EB; through C draw CF parallel to AE, intersecting
BE in G; and through G draw HI parallel to AB.

Now since AE is equal to AB, the angle ABE
is equal to AEB [I. v.]; but since BE intersects the
parallels AE, CF , the angle AEB is equal to CGB
[I. xxix.]. Hence the angle CBG is equal to CGB,
and therefore [I. vi.] CG is equal to CB; but CG is
equal to BI and CB to GI. Hence the ﬁgure CBIG
is a lozenge, and the angle CBI is right. Hence (I., Def. xxx.) it is a square.
In like manner the ﬁgure EF GH is a square.

52

Again, since CB is equal to CG, the rectangle AC . CB is equal to the
rectangle AC . CG; but AC . CG is the ﬁgure AG (Def. iv.). Therefore the
rectangle AC . CB is equal to the ﬁgure AG. Now the ﬁgures AG, GD are
equal [I. xliii.], being the complements about the diagonal of the parallelogram
AD. Hence the parallelograms AG, GD are together equal to twice the rectangle
AC . CB. Again, the ﬁgure HF is the square on HG, and HG is equal to AC.
Therefore HF is equal to the square on AC, and CI is the square on CB; but
the whole ﬁgure AD, which is the square on AB, is the sum of the four ﬁgures
HF , CI, AG, GD. Therefore the square on AB is equal to the sum of the
squares on AC, CB, and twice the rectangle AC . CB.

Or thus: On AB describe the square ABDE, and cut oﬀ
AH, EG, DF each equal to CB. Join CF , F G, GH, HC. Now
the four 4s ACH, CBF , F DG, GEH are evidently equal;
therefore their sum is equal to four times the 4ACH; but the
4ACH is half the rectangle AC . AH (i. Cor. 2)—that is, equal
to half the rectangle AC . CB. Therefore the sum of the four
triangles is equal to 2AC . CB.

Again, the ﬁgure CF GH is a square [I. xlvi., Cor. 3], and
equal to AC2 + AH 2 [I. xlvii.]—that is, equal to AC2 + CB2.
Hence the whole ﬁgure ABDE = AC2 + CB2 + 2AC . CB.

Or thus:

AB = AC + CB.

Squaring, we get

AB2 =AC2 + 2AC . CB + CB2.

Cor. 1.—The parallelograms about the diagonal of a square are squares.
Cor. 2.—The square on a line is equal to four

times the square on its half.

For let AB = 2AC, then AB2 = 4AC 2.
This Cor. may be proved by the First Book
thus: Erect CD at right angles to AB, and make
CD = AC or CB. Join AD, DB.

Then
In like manner,

AD2 = AC 2 + CD2 = 2AC 2

DB2 = 2CB2;

therefore

AD2 + DB2 = 2AC 2 + 2CB2 = 4AC 2.

But since the angle ADB is right, AD2 + DB2 = AB2;

therefore

AB2 = 4AC 2.

Cor. 3.—If a line be divided into any number of parts, the square on the
whole is equal to the sum of the squares on all the parts, together with twice the
sum of the rectangles contained by the several distinct pairs of parts.

53

Exercises.

1. Prove Proposition iv. by using Propositions ii. and iii.
2. If from the vertical angle of a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be let fall on the
hypotenuse, its square is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the hypotenuse.
3. From the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle portions are cut oﬀ equal to the adjacent
sides; prove that the square on the middle segment is equal to twice the rectangle contained
by the extreme segments.

4. In any right-angled triangle the square on the sum of the hypotenuse and perpendicular,
from the right angle on the hypotenuse, exceeds the square on the sum of the sides by the
square on the perpendicular.

5. The square on the perimeter of a right-angled triangle is equal to twice the rectangle
contained by the sum of the hypotenuse and one side, and the sum of the hypotenuse and the
other side.

PROP. V.—Theorem.

If a line (AB) be divided into two equal parts (at C), and also into two
unequal parts (at D), the rectangle (AD . DB) contained by the unequal parts,
together with the square on the part (CD) between the points of section, is equal
to the square on half the line.

Dem.—On CB describe the square
CBEF [I. xlvi.]. Join BF . Through D
draw DG parallel to CF , meeting BF in
H. Through H draw KM parallel to AB,
and through A draw AK parallel to CL
[I. xxxi.].

The parallelogram CM is equal to DE

[I. xliii., Cor. 2]; but AL is equal to CM [I. xxxvi.], because they are on equal
bases AC, CB, and between the same parallels; therefore AL is equal to DE:
to each add CH, and we get the parallelogram AH equal to the gnomon CM G;
but AH is equal to the rectangle AD . DH, and therefore equal to the rectangle
AD . DB, since DH is equal to DB [iv., Cor. 1]; therefore the rectangle AD . DB
is equal to the gnomon CM G, and the square on CD is equal to the ﬁgure LG.
Hence the rectangle AD . DB, together with the square on CD, is equal to the
whole ﬁgure CBEF —that is, to the square on CB.

Or thus:

therefore
Hence

AD = AC + CD = BC + CD;
BC − CD;
DB =

AD . BD = (BC + CD)(BC − CD) = BC 2 − CD2.

AD . BD + CD2 = BC 2.

Cor. 1.—The rectangle AD . DB is the rectangle contained by the sum of the
lines AC, CD and their diﬀerence; and we have proved it equal to the diﬀerence
between the square on AC and the square on CD. Hence the diﬀerence of the

54

squares on two lines is equal to the rectangle contained by their sum and their
diﬀerence.

Cor. 2.—The perimeter of the rectangle AH is equal to 2AB, and is therefore
independent of the position of the point D on the line AB; and the area of the
same rectangle is less than the square on half the line by the square on the
segment between D and the middle point of the line; therefore, when D is the
middle point, the rectangle will have the maximum area. Hence, of all rectangles
having the same perimeter, the square has the greatest area.

Exercises.

1. Divide a given line so that the rectangle contained by its parts may have a maximum

area.

2. Divide a given line so that the rectangle contained by its segments may be equal to a

the base, made by the perpendicular from the vertex.

5. The diﬀerence between the square on one of the equal sides of an isosceles triangle, and

contained by the segments of the base.

6. The square on either side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the rectangle contained

by the sum and the diﬀerence of the hypotenuse and the other side.

PROP. VI.—Theorem.

If a line (AB) be bisected (at C), and divided externally in any point (D),
the rectangle (AD . BD) contained by the segments made by the external point,
together with the square on half the line, is equal to the square on the segment
between the middle point and the point of external division.

Dem.—On CD describe the square
CDF E [I. xlvi.], and join DE; through
B draw BHG parallel to CE [I. xxxi.],
meeting DE in H; through H draw KLM
parallel to AD; and through A draw AK
parallel to CL. Then because AC is equal
to CB, the rectangle AL is equal to CH
[I. xxxvi.]; but the complements CH, HF
are equal [I. xliii.]; therefore AL is equal
to HF . To each of these equals add CM and LG, and we get AM and LG
equal to the square CDF E; but AM is equal to the rectangle AD . DM, and
therefore equal to the rectangle AD . DB, since DB is equal to DM; also LG
is equal to the square on CB, and CDF E is the square on CD. Hence the
rectangle AD . DB, together with the square on CB, it equal to the square on
CD.

55

Or thus:—
Dem.—On CB describe

the

square
CBEF [I. xlvi.].
Join BF . Through D
draw DG parallel to CF , meeting F B pro-
duced in H. Through H draw KM parallel
to AB. Through A draw AK parallel A to
CL [I. xxxi.].

The parallelogram CM is equal to DE
[I. xliii.]; but AL is equal to CM [I. xxxvi.],
because they are on equal bases AC, CB, and
between the same parallels; therefore AL is equal to DE. To each add CH, and
we get the parallelogram AH equal to the gnomon CM G; but AH is equal
to the rectangle AD . DH, and therefore equal to the rectangle AD . DB, since
DH is equal to DB [iv., Cor. 1]; therefore the rectangle AD . DB is equal to
the gnomon CM G, and the square on CB is the ﬁgure CE. Therefore the
rectangle AD . DB, together with the square on CB, is equal to the whole ﬁgure
LHGF —that is, equal to the square on LH or to the square on CD.

Or thus:

Hence
therefore

AD = AC + CD = CD + CB;
CD − CB.
BD =

AD . DB = (CD + CB)(CD − CB) = CD2 − CB2;

AD . DB + CB2 = CD2.

PROP. VII.—Theorem.

If a right line (AB) be divided into any two parts (at C), the sum of the
squares on the whole line (AB) and either segment (CB) is equal to twice the
rectangle (2AB . CB) contained by the whole line and that segment, together
with the square on the other segment.

56

Dem.—On AB describe the square ABDE. Join
BE. Through C draw CG parallel to AE, intersecting
BE in F . Through F draw HK parallel to AB.

Now the square AD is equal to the three ﬁgures AK,
F D, and GH: to each add the square CK, and we have
the sum of the squares AD, CK equal to the sum of the
three ﬁgures AK, CD, GH; but CD is equal to AK;
therefore the sum of the squares AD, CK is equal to
twice the ﬁgure AK, together with the ﬁgure GH. Now AK is the rectangle
AB . BK; but BK is equal to BC; therefore AK is equal to the rectangle
AB . BC, and AD is the square on AB; CK the square on CB; and GH is the
square on HF , and therefore equal to the square on AC. Hence the sum of the
squares on AB and BC is equal to twice the rectangle AB . BC, together with
the square on AC.

Or thus: On AC describe the square ACDE. Produce
the sides CD, DE, EA, and make each produced part
equal to CB. Join BF , F G, GH, HB. Then the ﬁgure
BF GH is a square [I. xlvi., Ex. 3], and it is equal to the
square on AC, together with the four equal triangles HAB,
BCF , F DG, GEH. Now [I. xlvii.], the ﬁgure BF GH is
equal to the sum of the squares on AB, AH—that is, equal
to the sum of the squares on AB, BC; and the sum of the
four triangles is equal to twice the rectangle AB . BC, for
each triangle is equal to half the rectangle AB . BC. Hence
the sum of the squares on AB, BC is equal to twice the
rectangle AB . BC, together with the square on AC.

Or thus:

therefore

therefore

AC = AB − BC;

AC2 = AB2 − 2AB . BC + BC2;
AC2 + 2AB . BC = AB2 + BC2.

PROP. VIII.–Theorem.

If a line (AB) be divided into two parts (at C), the square on the sum of the
whole line (AB) and either segment (BC) is equal to four times the rectangle
contained by the whole line (AB) and that segment, together with the square on
the other segment (AC).

57

Dem.—Produce AB to D. Make BD equal to
BC. On AD describe the square AEF D [I. xlvi.].
Join DE. Through C, B draw CH, BL parallel to
AE [I. xxxi.], and through K, I draw M N, P O
parallel to AD.

Since CO is the square on CD, and CK the
square on CB, and CB is the half of CD, CO is
equal to four times CK [iv., Cor. 1]. Again, since
CG, GI are the sides of equal squares, they are equal [I. xlvi., Cor. 1]. Hence
the parallelogram AG is equal to M I [I. xxxvi.]. In like manner IL is equal
to JF ; but M I is equal to IL [I. xliii.]. Therefore the four ﬁgures AG, M I,
IL, JF are all equal; hence their sum is equal to four times AG; and the square
CO has been proved to be equal to four times CK. Hence the gnomon AOH is
equal to four times the rectangle AK—that is, equal to four times the rectangle
AB . BC, since BC is equal to BK.

Again, the ﬁgure P H is the square on P I, and therefore equal to the square
on AC. Hence the whole ﬁgure AF , that is, the square on AD, is equal to four
times the rectangle AB . BC, together with the square on AC.

Or thus: Produce BA to D, and make AD = BC. On DB
describe the square DBEF . Cut oﬀ BG, EI, F L each equal to
BC. Through A and I draw lines parallel to DF , and through
G and L, lines parallel to AB.

Now it is evident that the four rectangles. AG, GI, IL,
LA are all equal; but AG is the rectangle AB . BG or AB . BC.
Therefore the sum of the four rectangles is equal to 4AB . BC.
Again, the ﬁgure N P is evidently equal to the square on AC.
Hence the whole ﬁgure, which is the square on BD, or the
square on the sum of AB and BC, is equal to 4AB . BC + AC2.

Or thus:

AB + BC = AC + 2BC;

therefore

(AB + BC)2 = AC2 + 4AC . CB + 4BC2
= AC2 + 4(AC + CB) . CB
= AC2 + 4AB . BC.

Direct sequence from v. or vi.
Since by v. or vi. the rectangle contained by any two lines is = the square
on half their sum − the square on half their diﬀerence; therefore four times the
rectangle contained by any two lines = the square on their sum − the square
on their diﬀerence.

Direct sequence of viii. from iv. and vii.
By iv., the square on the sum = the sum of the squares + twice the rectangle.
By vii., the square on the diﬀerence = the sum of the squares − twice the
rectangle. Therefore, by subtraction, the square on the sum − the square on
the diﬀerence = four times the rectangle.

2. Prove
3.1 Given the diﬀerence of two lines = R, and their rectangle = 4R2; ﬁnd the lines.

GK2 − EF 2 = 3AB(AO − BO).

PROP. IX.—Theorem.

If a line (AB) be bisected (at C) and divided into two unequal parts (at D),
the sum of the squares on the unequal parts (AD, DB) is double the sum of the
squares on half the line (AC), and on the segment (CD) between the points of
section.

Dem.—Erect CE at right angles to AB,
and make it equal to AC or CB. Join AE,
EB. Draw DF parallel to CE, and F G
parallel to CD. Join AF .

Because AC is equal to CE, and the an-
gle ACE is right, the angle CEA is half
a right angle.
In like manner the angles
CEB, CBE are half right angles; therefore
the whole angle AEF is right. Again, be-
cause GF is parallel to CB, and CE intersects them, the angle EGF is equal to
ECB; but ECB is right (const.); therefore EGF is right; and GEF has been
proved to be half a right angle; therefore the angle GF E is half a right angle [I.
xxxii.]. Therefore [I. vi.] GE is equal to GF . In like manner F D is equal to
DB.

Again, since AC is equal to CE, AC 2 is equal to CE2; but AE2 is equal to
AC 2 + CE2 [I. xlvii.]. Therefore AE2 is equal to 2AC 2. In like manner EF 2 is
equal to 2GF 2 or 2CD2. Therefore AE2 + EF 2 is equal to 2AC 2 + 2CD2; but
AE2 +EF 2 is equal to AF 2 [I. xlvii.]. Therefore AF 2 is equal to 2AC 2 +2CD2.
Again, since DF is equal to DB, DF 2 is equal to DB2: to each add AD2,
and we get AD2 + DF 2 equal to AD2 + DB2; but AD2 + DF 2 is equal to
AF 2; therefore AF 2 is equal to AD2 + DB2; and we have proved AF 2 equal to
2AC 2 + 2CD2. Therefore AD2 + DB2 is equal to 2AC 2 + 2CD2.

Or thus:
Square and add, and we get AD2 + DB2 = 2AC2 + 2CD2.

AD = AC + CD; DB = AC − CD.

it is bisected.

2. Divide a given line internally, so that the sum of the squares on the parts may be equal

3. If a line AB be bisected in C and divided unequally in D,

4. Twice the square on the line joining any point in the hypotenuse of a right-angled

5. If a line be divided into any number of parts, the continued product of all the parts is

a maximum, and the sum of their squares is a minimum when all the parts are equal.

PROP. X.—Theorem.

If a line (AB) be bisected (at C) and divided externally (at D), the sum of
the squares on the segments (AD, DB) made by the external point is equal to
twice the square on half the line, and twice the square on the segment between
the points of section.

Dem.—Erect CE at right an-
gles to AB, and make it equal to
AC or CB. Join AE, EB. Draw
DF parallel to CE, and produce
EB. Now since DF is parallel to
EC, the angle BDF is = to BCE
[I. xxix.], and [I. xv.]
the angle
DBF is = to EBC; but the sum of
the angles BCE, EBC is less than
two right angles [I. xvii.]; therefore
the sum of the angles BDF , DBF
is less than two right angles, and therefore [I., Axiom xii.] the lines EB, DF ,
if produced, will meet. Let them meet in F . Through F draw F G parallel to
AB, and produce EC to meet it in G. Join AF .

Because AC is equal to CE, and the angle ACE is right, the angle CEA is
half a right angle. In like manner the angles CEB, CBE are half right angles;
therefore the whole angle AEF is right. Again, because GF is parallel to CB,
and GE intersects them, the angle EGF is equal to ECB [I. xxix.]; but ECB
is right (const.); therefore EGF is right, and GEF has been proved to be half
a right angle; therefore [I. xxxii.] GF E is half a right angle, and therefore [I.
vi.] GE is equal to GF . In like manner F D is equal to DB.

Again, since AC is equal to CE, AC 2 is equal to CE2; but AE2 is equal to
AC 2 + CE2 [I. xlvii.]; therefore AE2 is equal to 2AC 2. In like manner EF 2 is
equal to 2GF 2 or 2CD2; therefore AE2 + EF 2 is equal to 2AC 2 + 2CD2; but
AE2 +EF 2 is equal to AF 2 [I. xlvii.]. Therefore AF 2 is equal to 2AC 2 +2CD2.
Again, since DF is equal to DB, DF 2 is equal to DB2: to each add AD2,
and we get AD2 + DF 2 equal to AD2 + DB2; but AD2 + DF 2 is equal to

60

AF 2; therefore AF 2 is equal to AD2 + DB2; and AF 2 has been proved equal
to 2AC 2 + 2CD2. Therefore AD2 + DB2 is equal to 2AC 2 + 2CD2.

Or thus:

AD = CD + AC,
BD = CD − AC.

Square and add, and we get AD2 + BD2 = 2CD2 + 2AC2.
The following enunciations include Propositions ix. and x.:—

PROP. XI.—Problem.

To divide a given ﬁnite line (AB) into two segments
(in H), so that the rectangle (AB . BH) contained by the
whole line and one segment may be equal to the square
on the other segment.

Sol.—On AB describe the square ABDC [I. xlvi.].
Bisect AC in E. Join BE. Produce EA to F , and make
EF equal to EB. On AF describe the square AF GH.
H is the point required.

Dem.—Produce GH to K. Then because CA is
bisected in E, and divided externally in F , the rectangle
CF . AF , together with the square on EA, is equal to
the square on EF [vi.]; but EF is equal to EB (const.);

61

therefore the rectangle CF . AF , together with EA2, is equal to EB2—that is
[I. xlvii.] equal to EA2 + AB2. Rejecting EA2, which is common, we get the
rectangle CF . AF equal to AB2. Again, since AF is equal to F G, being the
sides of a square, the rectangle CF . AF is equal to CF . F G—that is, to the
ﬁgure CG; and AB2 is equal to the ﬁgure AD; therefore CG is equal to AD.
Reject the part AK, which is common, and we get the ﬁgure F H equal to the
ﬁgure HD; but HD is equal to the rectangle AB . BH, because BD is equal to
AB, and F H is the square on AH. Therefore the rectangle AB . BH is equal to
the square on AH.

Def.—A line divided as in this Proposition is said to be divided in “extreme

and mean ratio.”

Cor. 1.—The line CF is divided in “extreme and mean ratio” at A.
Cor. 2.—If from the greater segment CA of CF we take a segment equal to
AF , it is evident that CA will be divided into parts respectively equal to AH,
HB. Hence, if a line be divided in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment
will be cut in the same manner by taking on it a part equal to the less; and the
less will be similarly divided by taking on it a part equal to the diﬀerence, and
so on, &c.

Cor. 3.—Let AB be divided in “extreme
and mean ratio” in C, then it is evident (Cor.
2) that AC is greater than CB. Cut oﬀ CD =
CB; then (Cor. 2) AC is cut in “extreme and mean ratio” at D, and CD is
greater than AD. Next, cut oﬀ DE equal to AD, and in the same manner we
have DE greater than EC, and so on. Now since CD is greater than AD, it
is evident that CD is not a common measure of AC and CB, and therefore
not a common measure of AB and AC. In like manner AD is not a common
measure of AC and CD, and therefore not a common measure of AB and AC.
Hence, no matter how far we proceed we cannot arrive at any remainder which
will be a common measure of AB and AC. Hence, the parts of a line divided in
“extreme and mean ratio” are incommensurable.

Exercises.

1. Cut a line externally in “extreme and mean ratio.”
2. The diﬀerence between the squares on the segments of a line divided in “extreme and

mean ratio” is equal to their rectangle.

3. In a right-angled triangle, if the square on one side be equal to the rectangle contained
by the hypotenuse and the other side, the hypotenuse is cut in “extreme and mean ratio” by
the perpendicular on it from the right angle.

4. If AB be cut in “extreme and mean ratio” at C, prove that

(1) AB2 + BC2 = 3AC2.
(2) (AB + BC)2 = 5AC2.

5. The three lines joining the pairs of points G, B; F , D; A, K, in the construction of

Proposition xi., are parallel.

6. If CH intersect BE in O, AO is perpendicular to CH.
7. If CH be produced, it meets BF at right angles.
8. ABC is a right-angled triangle having AB = 2AC: if AH be made equal to the diﬀerence

between BC and AC, AB is divided in “extreme and mean ratio” at H.

62

PROP. XII.—Theorem.

In an obtuse-angled triangle (ABC), the square on the side (AB) subtending
the obtuse angle exceeds the sum of the squares on the sides (BC, CA) contain-
ing the obtuse angle, by twice the rectangle contained by either of them (BC),
and its continuation (CD) to meet a perpendicular (AD) on it from the opposite
angle.

Dem.—Because BD is divided into two

parts in C, we have

BD2 = BC 2 + CD2 + 2BC . CD [iv.]

and

AD2 = AD2.

Hence, adding, since [I. xlvii.] BD2 + AD2 =
AB2, and CD2 + AD2 = CA2, we get

AB2 = BC 2 + CA2 + 2BC . CD.

Therefore AB2 is greater than BC 2 + CA2 by 2BC . CD.

The foregoing proof diﬀers from Euclid’s only in
the use of symbols. I have found by experience that
pupils more readily understand it than any other
method.

Or thus: By the First Book: Describe squares
on the three sides. Draw AE, BF , CG perpendic-
ular to the sides of the squares. Then it can be
proved exactly as in the demonstration of [I. xlvii.],
that the rectangle BG is equal to BE, AG to AF ,
and CE to CF . Hence the sum of the two squares
on AC, CB is less than the square on AB by twice
the rectangle CE; that is, by twice the rectangle
BC . CD.

Cor. 1.—If perpendiculars from A and B to the
opposite sides meet them in H and D, the rectangle
AC . CH is equal to the rectangle BC . CD.

a point D in the side AB produced, be equal to 2AB2; prove that AD is cut in “extreme and
mean ratio” at B.

63

PROP. XIII.—Theorem.

In any triangle (ABC), the square on any side subtending an acute angle (C)
is less than the sum of the squares on the sides containing that angle, by twice
the rectangle (BC, CD) contained by either of them (BC) and the intercept
(CD) between the acute angle and the foot of the perpendicular on it from the
opposite angle.

Dem.—Because BC is divided into two seg-

ments in D,

BC 2 + CD2 = BD2 + 2BC . CD [vii.];

and

AD2 = AD2.

Hence, adding, since

and
we get

CD2 + AD2 = AC 2 [I. xlvii.],

BD2 + AD2 = AB2,
BC 2 + AC 2 = AB2 + 2BC . CD.

Therefore AB2 is less than BC 2 + AC 2 by 2BC . CD.

Or thus: Describe squares on the sides. Draw AE, BF , CG perpendicular
to the sides; then, as in the demonstration of [I. xlvii.], the rectangle BG is
equal to BE; AG to AF , and CE to CF . Hence the sum of the squares on AC,
CB exceeds the square on AB by twice CE—that is, by 2BC . CD.

Observation.—By comparing the proofs of the pairs of Props. iv. and vii.; v. and vi.;
ix. and x.; xii. and xiii., it will be seen that they are virtually identical. In order to render
this identity more apparent, we have made some slight alterations in the usual proofs. The
pairs of Propositions thus grouped are considered in Modern Geometry not as distinct, but
each pair is regarded as one Proposition.

PROP. XIV.—Problem.

To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal ﬁgure (X).

Sol.—Construct [I. xlv.] the rectangle AC equal to X. Then, if the adjacent
sides AB, BC be equal, AC is a square, and the problem is solved; if not,
produce AB to E, and make BE equal to BC; bisect AE in F ; with F as
centre and F E as radius, describe the semicircle AGE; produce CB to meet it
in G. The square described on BG will be equal to X.

Dem.—Join F G. Then because AE is divided equally in F and unequally
in B, the rectangle AB . BE, together with F B2 is equal to F E2 [v.], that is,
to F G2; but F G2 is equal to F B2 + BG2 [I. xlvii.]. Therefore the rectangle
AB . BE + F B2 is equal to F B2 + BG2. Reject F B2, which is common, and we
have the rectangle AB . BE = BG2; but since BE is equal to BC, the rectangle
AB . BE is equal to the ﬁgure AC. Therefore BG2 is equal to the ﬁgure AC,
and therefore equal to the given rectilineal ﬁgure (X).

Cor.—The square on the perpendicular from any point in a semicircle on the
diameter is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the diameter.

BOOK III.

THEORY OF THE CIRCLE

DEFINITIONS.

i. Equal circles are those whose radii are equal.

This is a theorem, and not a deﬁnition. For if two circles have equal radii, they are
evidently congruent ﬁgures, and therefore equal. From this way of proving this theorem
Props. xxvi.–xxix. follow as immediate inferences.

ii. A chord of a circle is the line joining two points in its circumference.

If the chord be produced both ways, the whole line is called a secant, and each of the
parts into which a secant divides the circumference is called an arc—the greater the major
conjugate arc, and the lesser the minor conjugate arc.—Newcomb.

iii. A right line is said to touch a circle when
it meets the circle, and, being produced both
ways, does not cut it; the line is called a tangent
to the circle, and the point where it touches it
the point of contact.

In Modern Geometry a curve is considered as made
up of an inﬁnite number of points, which are placed in
order along the curve, and then the secant through two
consecutive points is a tangent. Euclid’s deﬁnition for a
tangent is quite inadequate for any curve but the circle,
and those derived from it by projection (the conic sections); and even for these the modern
deﬁnition is better.

iv. Circles are said to touch one an-
other when they meet, but do not inter-
sect. There are two species of contact:—
1. When each circle is external to the
other.
2. When one is inside the other.

The following is the modern deﬁnition of
curve-contact:— When two curves have two,
three, four, &c., consecutive points common,
they have contact of the ﬁrst, second, third, &c., orders.

v. A segment of a circle is a ﬁgure bounded by a chord and one of the arcs

into which it divides the circumference.

vi. Chords are said to be equally distant from the centre when the perpen-

diculars drawn to them from the centre are equal.

vii. The angle contained by two lines, drawn from any point in the circum-
ference of a segment to the extremities of its chord, is called an angle in the
segment.

68

viii. The angle of a segment is the angle contained between its chord and

the tangent at either extremity.

A theorem is tacitly assumed in this Deﬁnition, namely, that the angles which the chord

makes with the tangent at its extremities are equal. We shall prove this further on.

ix. An angle in a segment is said to stand on its conjugate arc.
x. Similar segments of circles are those that contain

equal angles.

xi. A sector of a circle is formed of two radii and

the arc included between them.

To a pair of radii may belong either of the two conjugate arcs

into which their ends divide the circle.—Newcomb.

xii. Concentric circles are those that have the same centre.
xiii. Points which lie on the circumference of a circle are said to be concyclic.
xiv. A cyclic quadrilateral is one which is inscribed in a circle.
xv. It will be proper to give here an explanation of the extended meaning of
the word angle in Modern Geometry. This extension is necessary in Trigonom-
etry, in Mechanics—in fact, in every application of Geometry, and has been
partly given in I. Def. ix.

Thus, if a line OA revolve about the point O, as in ﬁgures 1, 2, 3, 4, until
it comes into the position OB, the amount of the rotation from OA to OB is
called an angle. From the diagrams we see that in ﬁg. 1 it is less than two right
angles; in ﬁg. 2 it is equal to two right angles; in ﬁg. 3 greater than two right
angles, but less than four; and in ﬁg. 4 it is greater than four right angles. The
arrow-heads denote the direction or sense, as it is technically termed, in which
the line OA turns. It is usual to call the direction indicated in the above ﬁgures
positive, and the opposite negative. A line such as OA, which turns about a
ﬁxed point, is called a ray, and then we have the following deﬁnition:—

xvi. A ray which turns in the sense opposite to the hands of a watch describes
a positive angle, and one which turns in the same direction as the hands, a
negative angle.

PROP. I.—Problem.

To ﬁnd the centre of a given circle (ADB).

Sol.—Take any two points A, B in the circumfer-
ence. Join AB. Bisect it in C. Erect CD at right
angles to AB. Produce DC to meet the circle again
in E. Bisect DE in F . Then F is the centre.

Dem.—If possible, let any other point G be the
centre. Join GA, GC, GB. Then in the triangles
ACG, BCG we have AC equal to CB (const.), CG
common, and the base GA equal to GB, because they
are drawn from G, which is, by hypothesis, the centre,
to the circumference. Hence [I. viii.] the angle ACG is equal to the adjacent
angle BCG, and therefore [I. Def. xiii.] each is a right angle; but the angle
ACD is right (const.); therefore ACD is equal to ACG—a part equal to the
whole—which is absurd. Hence no point can be the centre which is not in the
line DE. Therefore F , the middle point of DE, must be the centre.

The foregoing proof may be abridged as follows:—

Because ED bisects AB at right angles, every point equally distant from, the
points A, B must lie in ED [I. x. Ex. 2]; but the centre is equally distant from
A and B; hence the centre must be in ED; and since it must be equally distant
from E and D, it must be the middle point of DE.

Cor. 1.—The line which bisects any chord of a circle perpendicularly passes

through the centre of the circle.

Cor. 2.—The locus of the centres of the circles which pass through two ﬁxed

points is the line bisecting at right angles that connecting the two points.

Cor. 3.—If A, B, C be three points in the circumference of a circle, the lines

bisecting perpendicularly the chords AB, BC intersect in the centre.

PROP. II.—Theorem.

If any two points (A, B) be taken in the circumference of a circle—1. The
segment (AB) of the indeﬁnite line through these points which lies between them
falls within the circle. 2. The remaining parts of the line are without the circle.

Dem.—1. Let C be the centre. Take any
point D in AB. Join CA, CD, CB. Now the
angle ADC is [I. xvi.] greater than ABC;
but the angle ABC is equal to CAB [I. v.],
because the triangle CAB is isosceles; there-
fore the angle ADC is greater than CAD.
Hence AC is greater than CD [I. xix.]; there-
fore CD is less than the radius of the circle,
consequently the point D must be within the
circle (note on I. Def. xxiii.).

In the same manner every other point between A and B lies within the circle.
2. Take any point E in AB produced either way. Join CE. Then the angle
ABC is greater than AEC [I. xvi.]; therefore CAB is greater than AEC. Hence
CE is greater than CA, and the point E is without the circle.

70

We have added the second part of this Proposition. The indirect proof given of the ﬁrst
part in several editions of Euclid is very inelegant; it is one of those absurd things which give
many students a dislike to Geometry.

Cor. 1.—Three collinear points cannot be concyclic.
Cor. 2.—A line cannot meet a circle in more than two points.
Cor. 3.—The circumference of a circle is everywhere concave towards the

centre.

PROP. III.–Theorem.

If a line (AB) passing through the centre of a circle bisect a chord (CD),
which does not pass through the centre, it cuts it at right angles. 2. If it cuts it
at right angles, it bisects it.

Dem.—1. Let O be the centre of the circle.
Join OC, OD. Then the triangles CEO, DEO
have CE equal to ED (hyp.), EO common, and
OC equal to OD, because they are radii of the
circle; hence [I. viii.] the angle CEO is equal to
DEO, and they are adjacent angles. Therefore [I.
Def. xiii.] each is a right angle. Hence AB cuts
CD at right angles.

2. The same construction being made: because
OC is equal to OD, the angle OCD is equal to
ODC [I. v.], and CEO is equal to DEO (hyp.), because each is right. Therefore
the triangles CEO, DEO have two angles in one respectively equal to two angles
in the other, and the side EO common. Hence [I. xxvi.] the side CE is equal
to ED. Therefore CD is bisected in E.

2. May be proved as follows:—

but
Hence

OC 2 = OE2+EC 2 [I. xlvii.], and OD2 = OE2 + ED2;

OC 2 =OD2; ∴ OE2 + EC 2 = OE2 + ED2.

EC 2 = ED2, and EC = ED.

Observation.—The three theorems, namely, Cor. 1., Prop. i., and Parts 1, 2, of Prop. iii.,
are so related, that any one being proved directly, the other two follow by the Rule of Identity.

Cor. 1.—The line which bisects perpendicularly one of two parallel chords

of a circle bisects the other perpendicularly.

Exercises.

1. If a chord of a circle subtend a right angle at a given point, the locus of its middle point

is a circle.

2. Every circle passing through a given point, and having its centre on a given line, passes

through another given point.

3. Draw a chord in a given circle which shall subtend a right angle at a given point, and

be parallel to a given line.

PROP. IV.—Theorem.

Two chords of a circle (AB, CD) which are not both diameters cannot bisect

each other, though either may bisect the other.

Dem.—Let O be the centre. Let AB, CD in-
tersect in E; then since AB, CD are not both di-
ameters, join OE. If possible let AE be equal to
EB, and CE equal to ED. Now, since OE pass-
ing through the centre bisects AB, which does not
pass through the centre, it is at right angles to it;
therefore the angle AEO is right. In like manner
the angle CEO is right. Hence AEO is equal to
CEO—that is, a part equal to the whole—which
is absurd. Therefore AB and CD do not bisect each other.

Cor.—If two chords of a circle bisect each other, they are both diameters.

PROP. V.—Theorem.

If two circles (ABC, ABD) cut one another in any point (A), they are not

concentric.

Dem.—If possible let them have a common
centre at O. Join OA, and draw any other line
OD, cutting the circles in C and D respectively.
Then because O is the centre of the circle ABC,
OA is equal to OC. Again, because O is the centre
of the circle ABD, OA is equal to OD. Hence OC
is equal to OD—a part equal to the whole—which
is absurd. Therefore the circles are not concentric.

Exercises.

1. If two non-concentric circles intersect in one point, they must intersect in another point.
For, let O, O0 be the centres, A the point of intersection; from A let fall the ⊥ AC on the line
OO0. Produce AC to B, making BC = CA: then B is another point of intersection.

2. Two circles cannot have three points in common without wholly coinciding.

72

PROP. VI.—Theorem.

If one circle (ABC) touch another circle (ADE)
internally in any point (A), it is not concentric with
it.

Dem.—If possible let the circles be concentric,
and let O be the centre of each. Join OA, and draw
any other line OD, cutting the circles in the points
B, D respectively. Then because O is the centre of
each circle (hyp.), OB and OD are each equal to
OA; therefore OB is equal to OD, which is impos-
sible. Hence the circles cannot have the same centre.

PROP. VII.—Theorem.

If from any point (P ) within a circle, which is not the centre, lines (P A, P B,
P C, &c.), one of which passes through the centre, be drawn to the circumference,
then—1. The greatest is the line (P A) which passes through the centre. 2. The
production (P E) of this in the opposite direction is the least. 3. Of the others,
that which is nearest to the line through the centre is greater than every one more
remote. 4. Any two lines making equal angles with the diameter on opposite
sides are equal. 5. More than two equal right lines cannot be drawn from the
given point (P ) to the circumference.

Dem.—1. Let O be the centre. Join OB. Now since O is the centre, OA is
equal to OB: to each add OP , and we have AP equal to the sum of OB, OP ;
but the sum of OB, OP is greater than P B [I. xx.]. Therefore P A is greater
than P B.

2. Join OD. Then [I. xx.] the sum of OP ,
P D is greater than OD; but OD is equal to OE
[I. Def. xxx.]. Therefore the sum of OP , P D is
greater than OE. Reject OP , which is common,
and we have P D greater than P E.

3. Join OC; then two triangles P OB, P OC
have the side OB equal to OC [I. Def. xxx.],
and OP common; but the angle P OB is greater
than P OC; therefore [I. xxiv.] the base P B is
greater than P C. In like manner P C is greater
than P D.

4. Make at the centre O the angle P OF equal

to P OD. Join P F . Then the triangles P OD, P OF have the two sides OP ,
OD in one respectively equal to the sides OP , OF in the other, and the angle
P OD equal to the angle P OF ; hence P D is equal to P F [I. iv.], and the angle
OP D equal to the angle OP F . Therefore P D and P F make equal angles with
the diameter.

73

5. A third line cannot be drawn from P equal to either of the equal lines
P D, P F . If possible let P G be equal to P D, then P G is equal to P F —that is,
the line which is nearest to the one through the centre is equal to the one which
is more remote, which is impossible. Hence three equal lines cannot be drawn
from P to the circumference.

Cor. 1.—If two equal lines P D, P F be drawn from a point P to the circum-
ference of a circle, the diameter through P bisects the angle DP F formed by
these lines.

Cor. 2.—If P be the common centre of circles whose radii are P A, P B, P C,
&c., then—1. The circle whose radius is the maximum line (P A) lies outside
the circle ADE, and touches it in A [Def. iv.]. 2. The circle whose radius is
the minimum line (P E) lies inside the circle ADE, and touches it in E. 3. A
circle having any of the remaining lines (P D) as radius cuts ADE in two points
(D, F ).

Observation.—Proposition vii. aﬀords a good illustration of the following important deﬁni-
tion (see Sequel to Euclid, p. 13):—If a geometrical magnitude varies its position continuously
according to any law, and if it retains the same value throughout, it is said to be a constant,
such as the radius of a circle revolving round the centre; but if it goes on increasing for some
time, and then begins to decrease, it is said to be a maximum at the end of the increase.
Thus, in the foregoing ﬁgure, P A, supposed to revolve round P and meet the circle, is a
maximum. Again, if it decreases for some time, and then begins to increase, it is a minimum
at the commencement of the increase. Thus P E, supposed as before to revolve round P and
meet the circle, is a minimum. Proposition viii. will give other illustrations.

PROP. VIII.—Theorem.

If from any point (P ) outside a cir-
cle, lines (P A, P B, P C, &c.) be drawn
to the concave circumference, then—
1. The maximum is that which passes
through the centre. 2. Of the others,
that which is nearer to the one through
the centre is greater than the one more
remote. Again,
if lines be drawn to
the convex circumference—3. The min-
imum is that whose production passes
through the centre.
4. Of the oth-
ers, that which is nearer to the min-
imum is less than one more remote.
5. From the given point (P ) there can be
drawn two equal lines to the concave or
the convex circumference, both of which
make equal angles with the line passing
through the centre. 6. More than two
equal lines cannot be drawn from the given point (P ) to either circumference.

Dem.—1. Let O be the centre. Join OB. Now since O is the centre, OA is
equal to OB: to each add OP , and we have AP equal to the sum of OB, OP ;

74

but the sum of OB, OP is greater than BP [I. xx.]. Therefore AP is greater
than BP .

2. Join OC, OD. The two triangles BOP , COP have the side OB equal
to OC, and OP common, and the angle BOP greater than COP ; therefore the
base BP is greater than CP [I. xxiv.]. In like manner CP is greater than DP ,
&c.

3. Join OF . Now in the triangle OF P the sum of the sides OF , F P is
greater than OP [I. xx.]; but OF is equal to OE [I. Def. xxx.]. Reject them,
and F P will remain greater than EP .

4. Join OG, OH. The two triangles GOP , F OP have two sides GO, OP in
one respectively equal to two sides F O, OP in the other; but the angle GOP
is greater than F OP ; therefore [I. xxiv.] the base GP is greater than F P . In
like manner HP is greater than GP .

5. Make the angle P OI equal P OF [I. xxiii.]. Join IP . Now the triangles
IOP , F OP have two sides IO, OP in one respectively equal to two sides F O,
OP in the other, and the angle IOP equal to F OP (const.); therefore [I. iv.]
IP is equal to F P .

Cor. 2.—If two equal lines be drawn from P to either the convex or concave
circumference, the diameter through P bisects the angle between them, and the
parts of them intercepted by the circle are equal.

Cor. 3.—If P be the common centre of circles whose radii are lines drawn
from P to the circumference of HDE, then—1. The circle whose radius is the
minimum line (P E) has contact of the ﬁrst kind with ADE [Def. iv.]. 2. The
circle whose radius is the maximum line (P A) has contact of the second kind.
3. A circle having any of the remaining lines (P F ) as radius intersects HDE in
two points (F, I).

6. A third line cannot be drawn from P equal to either of the lines IP , F P .
For if possible let P K be equal to P F ; then P K is equal to P I—that is, one
which is nearer to the minimum equal to one more remote—which is impossible.
Cor. 1.—If P I be produced to meet the circle again in L, P L is equal to

P B.

PROP. IX.—Theorem.

A point (P ) within a circle (ABC), from which
more than two equal lines (P A, P B, P C, &c.) can
be drawn to the circumference, is the centre.

Dem.—If P be not the centre, let O be the cen-
tre. Join OP , and produce it to meet the circle in D
and E; then DE is the diameter, and P is a point in
it which is not the centre: therefore [vii.] only two
equal lines can be drawn from P to the circumfer-
ence; but three equal lines are drawn (hyp.), which
is absurd. Hence P must be the centre.

75

Or thus: Since the lines AP , BP are equal, the line bisecting the angle AP B [vii. Cor. 1]
must pass through the centre:
in like manner the line bisecting the angle BP C must pass
through the centre. Hence the point of intersection of these bisectors, that is, the point P ,
must be the centre.

PROP. X.—Theorem.

If two circles have more than two points common, they must coincide.

Dem.—Let X be one of the circles; and if
possible let another circle Y have three points, A,
B, C, in common with X, without coinciding with
it. Find P , the centre of X. Join P A, P B, P C.
Then since P is the centre of X, the three lines
P A, P B, P C are equal to one another.

Again, since Y is a circle and P a point, from
which three equal
lines P A, P B, P C can be
drawn to its circumference, P must be the cen-
tre of Y . Hence X and Y are concentric, which
[v.] is impossible.

Cor.—Two circles not coinciding cannot have more than two points common.
Compare I., Axiom x., that two right lines not coinciding cannot have more than
one point common.

PROP. XI.—Theorem.

If one circle (CP D) touch another circle (AP B) internally at any point P , the

line joining the centres must pass through that point.

Dem.—Let O be the centre of AP B. Join OP .
I say the centre of the smaller circle is in the line
OP . If not, let it be in any other position such as
E. Join OE, EP , and produce OE through E to
meet the circles in the points C, A. Now since E is a
point in the diameter of the larger circle between the
centre and A, EA is less than EP [vii. 2]; but EP is
equal to EC (hyp.), being radii of the smaller circle.
Hence EA is less than EC; which is impossible;
consequently the centre of the smaller circle must
be in the line OP . Let it be H; then we see that the line joining the centres
passes through the point P .

Or thus: Since EP is a line drawn from a point within the circle AP B to
the circumference, but not forming part of the diameter through E, the circle
whose centre is E and radius EP cuts [vii., Cor. 2] AP B in P , but it touches
it (hyp.) also in P , which is impossible. Hence the centre of the smaller circle
CP D must be in the line OP .

76

PROP. XII.—Theorem.

If two circles (P CF, P DE) have external contact at any point P , the line

joining their centres must pass through that point.

Dem.—Let A be the centre of one of
the circles. Join AP , and produce it to
meet the second circle again in E.
I say
the centre of the second circle is in the line
P E.
If not, let it be elsewhere, as at B.
Join AB, intersecting the circles in C and
D, and join BP . Now since A is the centre
of the circle P CF , AP is equal to AC; and since B is the centre of the circle
P DE, BP is equal to BD. Hence the sum of the lines AP , BP is equal to
the sum of the lines AC, DB; but AB is greater than the sum of AC and DB;
therefore AB is greater than the sum of AP , P B—that is, one side of a triangle
greater than the sum of the other two–which [I. xx.] is impossible. Hence the
centre of the second circle must be in the line P E. Let it be G, and we see that
the line through the centres passes through the point P .

Or thus: Since BP is a line drawn from a point without the circle P CF
to its circumference, and when produced does not pass through the centre, the
circle whose centre is B and radius BP must cut the circle P CF in P [viii.,
Cor. 3]; but it touches it (hyp.) also in P , which is impossible. Hence the centre
of the second circle must be in the line P E.

Observation.—Propositions xi, xii., may both be included in one enunciation as follows:—
“If two circles touch each other at any point, the centres and that point are collinear.” And this
latter Proposition is a limiting case of the theorem given in Proposition iii., Cor. 4, that “The
line joining the centres of two intersecting circles bisects the common chord perpendicularly.”

Suppose the circle whose centre is O and one of the points of intersection A to remain
ﬁxed, while the second circle turns round that point in such a manner that the second point
of intersection B becomes ultimately consecutive to A; then, since the line OO0 always bisects
AB, we see that when B ultimately becomes consecutive to A, the line OO0 passes through
A. In consequence of the motion, the common chord will become in the limit a tangent to
each circle, as in the second diagram.—Comberousse, G´eom´etrie Plane, page 57.

Cor. 1.—If two circles touch each other, their point of contact is the union of two points

of intersection. Hence a contact counts for two intersections.

77

Cor. 2.—If two circles touch each other at any point, they
cannot have any other common point. For, since two circles
cannot have more than two points common [x.], and that the
point of contact is equivalent to two common points, circles that
touch cannot have any other point common. The following is a
formal proof of this Proposition:—Let O, O0 be the centres of
the two circles, A the point of contact, and let O0 lie between O
and A; take any other point B in the circumference of O. Join
O0B; then [vii.] O0B is greater than O0A; therefore the point C
is outside the circumference of the smaller circle. Hence B cannot be common to both circles.
In like manner, they cannot have any other common point but A.

PROP. XIII.—Theorem.

Two circles cannot have double contact, that it, cannot touch each other in two

points.

Dem.—1. If possible let two circles touch each
other at two points A and B. Now since the two
circles touch each other in A, the line joining their
centres passes through A [xi.].
In like manner,
it passes through B. Hence the centres and the
points A, B are in one right line; therefore AB is a
diameter of each circle. Hence, if AB be bisected
in E, E must be the centre of each circle—that is,
the circles are concentric—which [v.] is impossi-
ble.

2. If two circles touched each other externally in two distinct points, then
the line joining the centres should pass through each point, which is

[xii.]
impossible.

Or thus: Draw a line bisecting AB at right angles. Then this line [i., Cor. 1]
must pass through the centre of each circle, and therefore [xi. xii.] must pass
through each point of contact, which is impossible. Hence two circles cannot
have double contact.

This Proposition is an immediate inference from the theorem [xii., Cor. 1], that a point
of contact counts for two intersections, for then two contacts would be equivalent to four
intersections; but there cannot be more than two intersections [x.].
It also follows from
Prop. xii., Cor. 2, that if two circles touch each other in a point A, they cannot have any
other point common; hence they cannot touch again in B.

Exercises.

1. If a variable circle touch two ﬁxed circles externally, the diﬀerence of the distances of
its centre from the centres of the ﬁxed circles is equal to the diﬀerence or the sum of their
radii, according as the contacts are of the same or of opposite species (Def. iv.).

2. If a variable circle be touched by one of two ﬁxed circles internally, and touch the
other ﬁxed circle either externally or internally, the sum of the distances of its centre from
the centres of the ﬁxed circles is equal to the sum or the diﬀerence of their radii, according as
the contact with the second circle is of the ﬁrst or second kind.

3. If through the point of contact of two touching circles any secant be drawn cutting the

circles again in two points, the radii drawn to these points are parallel.

78

4. If two diameters of two touching circles be parallel, the lines from the point of contact

to the extremities of one diameter pass through the extremities of the other.

PROP. XIV.—Theorem.

In equal circles—1. equal chords (AB, CD) are equally distant from the

centre. 2. chords which are equally distant from the centre are equal.

Dem.—1. Let O be the centre. Draw the per-
pendiculars OE, OF . Join AO, CO. Then because
AB is a chord in a circle, and OE is drawn from
the centre cutting it at right angles,
it bisects it
[iii.]; therefore AE is the half of AB. In like man-
ner, CF is the half of CD; but AB is equal to
CD (hyp.). Therefore AE is equal to CF [I., Ax-
iom vii.]. And because E is a right angle, AO2 is
equal to AE2 + EO2. In like manner, CO2 is equal
to CF 2 + F O2; but AO2 is equal to CO2. Therefore
AE2 + EO2 is equal to CF 2 + F O2; and AE2 has been proved equal to CF 2.
Hence EO2 is equal to F O2; therefore EO is equal to F O. Hence AB, CD are
(Def. vi.) equally distant from the centre.

2. Let EO be equal to F O, it is required to prove AB equal to CD. The same
construction being made, we have, as before, AE2 + EO2 equal to CF 2 + F O2;
but EO2 is equal to F O2 (hyp.). Hence AE2 is equal to CF 2, and AE is equal
to CF ; but AB is double of AE, and CD double of CF . Therefore AB is equal
to CD.

If a chord of given length slide round a ﬁxed circle—1. the locus of its middle point is a

circle; 2. the locus of any point ﬁxed in the chord is a circle.

Exercise.

PROP. XV.—Theorem.

The diameter (AB) is the greatest chord in a circle; and of the others, the
chord (CD) which is nearer to the centre is greater than (EF ) one more remote,
and the greater is nearer to the centre than the less.

Dem.—1. Join OC, OD, OE, and draw the
perpendiculars OG, OH; then because O is the
centre, OA is equal to OC [I., Def. xxxii.], and
OB is equal to OD. Hence AB is equal to the
sum of OC and OD; but the sum of OC, OD is
greater than CD [I. xx.]. Therefore AB is greater
than CD.

2. Because the chord CD is nearer to the cen-
tre than EF , OG is less than OH; and since the

79

triangles OGC, OHE are right-angled, we have OC 2 = OG2 + GC 2, and
OE2 = OH 2 + HE2; therefore OG2 + GC 2 = OH 2 + HE2; but OG2 is less
than OH 2; therefore GC 2 is greater than HE2, and GC is greater than HE,
but CD and EF are the doubles of GC and HE. Hence CD is greater than
EF .

3. Let CD be greater than EF , it is required to prove that OG is less than

OH.

As before, we have OG2 + GC 2 equal to OH 2 + HE2; but CG2 is greater

than EH 2; therefore OG2 is less than OH 2. Hence OG is less than OH.

Exercises.

1. The shortest chord which can be drawn through a given point within a circle is the

perpendicular to the diameter which passes through that point.

2. Through a given point, within or without a given circle, draw a chord of length equal

to that of a given chord.

3. Through one of the points of intersection of two circles draw a secant—1. the sum of
whose segments intercepted by the circles shall be a maximum; 2. which shall be of any length
less than that of the maximum.

4. Three circles touch each other externally at A, B, C; the chords AB, AC of two of them
are produced to meet the third again in the points D and E; prove that DE is a diameter of
the third circle, and parallel to the line joining the centres of the others.

PROP. XVI.—Theorem.

1. The perpendicular (BI) to the diameter (AB) of a circle at its extremity
(B) touches the circle at that point. 2. Any other line (BH) through the same
point cuts the circle.

Dem.—1. Take any point I, and join it to
the centre C. Then because the angle CBI is a
right angle, CI 2 is equal to CB2+BI 2 [I. xlvii.];
therefore CI 2 is greater than CB2. Hence CI
is greater than CB, and the point I [note on I.,
Def. xxxii.] is without the circle. In like manner,
every other point in BI, except B, is without the
circle. Hence, since BI meets the circle at B, but
does not cut it, it must touch it.

2. To prove that BH, which is not perpen-

dicular to AB, cuts the circle. Draw CG perpendicular to HB. Now BC 2 is
equal to CG2 + GB2. Therefore BC 2 is greater than CG2, and BC is greater
than CG. Hence [note on I., Def. xxxii.] the point G must be within the circle,
and consequently the line BG produced must meet the circle again, and must
therefore cut it.

This Proposition may be proved as follows:
At every point on a circle the tangent is perpendicular to the radius.

80

Let P and Q be two consecutive points on the cir-
cumference. Join CP , CQ, P Q; produce P Q both
ways. Now since P and Q are consecutive points, P Q
is a tangent (Def. iii.). Again, the sum of the three
angles of the triangle CP Q is equal to two right angles;
but the angle C is inﬁnitely small, and the others are
equal. Hence each of them is a right angle. Therefore
the tangent is perpendicular to the diameter.

Or thus: A tangent is a limiting position of a secant, namely, when the
secant moves out until the two points of intersection with the circle become
consecutive; but the line through the centre which bisects the part of the secant
within the circle [iii.] is perpendicular to it. Hence, in the limit the tangent is
perpendicular to the line from the centre to the point of contact.

Or again: The angle CP R is always equal to CQS; hence, when P and
Q come together each is a right angle, and the tangent is perpendicular to the
radius.

PROP. XVII.—Problem.

From a given point (P ) without a given circle (BCD) to draw a tangent to the

circle.

81

Sol.—Let O (ﬁg. 1) be the centre of the given circle. Join OP , cutting the
circumference in C. With O as centre, and OP as radius, describe the circle
AP E. Erect CA at right angles to OP . Join OA, intersecting the circle BCD
in B. Join BP ; it will be the tangent required.

Dem.—Since O is the centre of the two circles, we have OA equal to OP ,
and OC equal to OB. Hence the two triangles AOC, P OB have the sides
OA, OC in one respectively equal to the sides OP , OB in the other, and the
contained angle common to both. Hence [I. iv.] the angle OCA is equal to
OBP ; but OCA is a right angle (const.); therefore OBP is a right angle, and
[xvi.] P B touches the circle at B.

Cor.—If AC (ﬁg. 2) be produced to E, OE joined, cutting the circle BCD

in D, and the line DP drawn, DP will be another tangent from P .

Exercises.

1. The two tangents P B, P D (ﬁg. 2) are equal to one another, because the square of each

is equal to the square of OP minus the square of the radius.

2. If two circles be concentric, all tangents to the inner from points on the outer are equal.
3. If a quadrilateral be circumscribed to a circle, the sum of one pair of opposite sides is

equal to the sum of the other pair.

4. If a parallelogram be circumscribed to a circle it must be a lozenge, and its diagonals

intersect in the centre.

5. If BD be joined, intersecting OP in F , OP is perpendicular to BD.
6. The locus of the intersection of two equal tangents to two circles is a right line (called

the radical axis of the two circles).

7. Find a point such that tangents from it to three given circles shall be equal. (This point

is called the radical centre of the three circles.)

8. The rectangle OF . OP is equal to the square of the radius.
Def. Two points, such as F and P , the rectangle of whose distances OF , OP from the
centre is equal to the square of the radius, are called inverse points with respect to the circle.
9. The intercept made on a variable tangent by two ﬁxed tangents subtends a constant

angle at the centre.

10. Draw a common tangent to two circles. Hence, show how to draw a line cutting two

circles, so that the intercepted chords shall be of given lengths.

PROP. XVIII.—Theorem

If a line (CD) touch a circle, the line (OC) from the centre to the point of

contact is perpendicular to it.

Dem.—If not, suppose another line OG
drawn from the centre to be perpendicular to
CD. Let OG cut the circle in F . Then because
the angle OGC is right (hyp.) the angle OCG
[I. xvii.] must be acute. Therefore [I. xix.]
OC is greater than OG; but OC is equal to OF
[I. Def. xxxii.]; therefore OF is greater than
OG—that is, a part greater than the whole,
which is impossible. Hence OC must be per-
pendicular to CD.

82

Or thus: Since the perpendicular must be the shortest line from O to CD, and OC is

evidently the shortest line; therefore OC must be perpendicular to CD.

PROP. XIX.—Theorem.

If a line (AB) be a tangent to a circle, the line (AC) drawn at right angles to

it from the point of contact passes through the centre.

If the centre be not in AC, let O be the
centre. Join AO. Then because AB touches the
circle, and OA is drawn from the centre to the
point of contact, OA is at right angles to AB
[xviii.]; therefore the angle OAB is right, and
the angle CAB is right (hyp.); therefore OAB
is equal to CAB—a part equal to the whole,
which is impossible. Hence the centre must be
in the line AC.

Cor.—If a number of circles touch the same
line at the same point, the locus of their centres
is the perpendicular to the line at the point.

Observation.—Propositions xvi., xviii., xix., are so related that any two can be inferred
from the third by the “Rule of Identity.” Hence it would, in strict logic, be suﬃcient to prove

any one of the three, and the others would follow. Again, these three theorems are limiting
cases of Proposition i., Cor. 1., and Parts 1, 2, of Proposition iii., namely, when the points in
which the chord cuts the circle become consecutive.

PROP. XX.—Theorem.

The angle (AOB) at the centre (O) of a circle is double the angle (ACB) at

the circumference standing on the same arc.

Dem.—Join CO, and produce it to E. Then because OA is equal to OC,
the angle ACO is equal to OAC; but the angle AOE is equal to the sum of the
two angles OAC, ACO. Hence the angle AOE is double the angle ACO. In like

83

manner the angle EOB is double the angle OCB. Hence (by adding in ﬁgs. (α),
(β), and subtracting in (γ)), the angle AOB is double of the angle ACB.

Cor.—If AOB be a straight line, ACB will be a right angle—that is, the

angle in a semicircle is a right angle (compare xxxi.).

PROP. XXI.—Theorem.

The angles (ACB, ADB) in the same segment of a circle are equal.

Dem.—Let O be the centre. Join OA, OB. Then the angle AOB is double
of the angle ACB [xx.], and also double of the angle ADB. Therefore the angle
ACB is equal to the angle ADB.

The following is the proof of the second part—that is, when the arc AB
is not greater than a semicircle, without using angles greater than two right
angles:—

Let O be the centre. Join CO, and produce
it to meet the circle again in E. Join DE. Now
since O is the centre, the segment ACE is greater
than a semicircle; hence, by the ﬁrst case, ﬁg. (α),
the angle ACE is equal to ADE. In like manner
the angle ECB is equal to EDB. Hence the whole
angle ACB is equal to the whole angle ADB.

Cor. 1.—If two triangles ACB, ADB on the
same base AB, and on the same side of it, have
equal vertical angles, the four points A, C, D, B are concyclic.

Cor. 2.—If A, B be two ﬁxed points, and if C varies its position in such a
way that the angle ACB retains the same value throughout, the locus of C is a
circle.

In other words—Given the base of a triangle and the vertical angle, the locus

of the vertex is a circle.

84

Exercises.

1. Given the base of a triangle and the vertical angle, ﬁnd the locus—

(1) of the intersection of its perpendiculars;
(2) of the intersection of the internal bisectors of its base angles;
(3) of the intersection of the external bisectors of the base angles;
(4) of the intersection of the external bisector of one base angle and the internal bisector

of the other.

2. If the sum of the squares of two lines be given, their sum is a maximum when the lines

are equal.

3. Of all triangles having the same base and vertical angle, the sum of the sides of an

isosceles triangle is a maximum.

4. Of all triangles inscribed in a circle, the equilateral triangle has the maximum perimeter.
5. Of all concyclic ﬁgures having a given number of sides, the area is a maximum when

the sides are equal.

PROP. XXII.—Theorem.

The sum of the opposite angles of a quadrilateral (ABCD) inscribed in a circle

is two right angles.

Dem.—Join AC, BD. The angle ABD is equal to ACD, being in the same
segment ABCD [xxi.]; and the angle DBC is equal to DAC, because they are
in the same segment DABC. Hence the whole angle ABC is equal to the sum
of the two angles ACD, DAC. To each add the angle CDA, and we have the
sum of the two angles ABC, CDA equal to the sum of the three angles ACD,
DAC, CDA of the triangle ACD; but the sum of the three angles of a triangle
is equal to two right angles [I. xxxii.]. Therefore the sum of ABC, CDA is two
right angles.

Or thus: Let O be the centre of the circle. Join OA, OC (see ﬁg. 2). Now
the angle AOC is double of CDA [xx.], and the angle COA is double of ABC.
Hence the sum of the angles [I. Def. ix., note] AOC, COA is double of the sum
of the angles CDA, ABC; but the sum of two angles AOC, COA is four right
angles. Therefore the sum of the angles CDA, ABC is two right angles.

Or again: Let O be the centre (ﬁg. 2). Join OA, OB OC, OD. Then the
four triangles AOB, BOC, COD, DOA are each isosceles. Hence the angle
OAB is equal to the angle OBA, and the angle OAD equal to the angle ODA;
therefore the angle BAD is equal to the sum of the angles OBA, ODA. In like

85

manner the angle BCD is equal to the sum of the angles OBC, ODC. Hence
the sum of the two angles BAD, BCD is equal to the sum of the two angles
ABC, ADC, and hence each sum is two right angles.

Cor.—If a parallelogram be inscribed in a circle it is a rectangle.

Exercises.

1. If the opposite angles of a quadrilateral be supplemental, it is cyclic.
2. If a ﬁgure of six sides be inscribed in a circle, the sum of any three alternate angles is

four right angles.

3. A line which makes equal angles with one pair of opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral,

makes equal angles with the remaining pair and with the diagonals.

4. If two opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral be produced to meet, and a perpendicular
be let fall on the bisector of the angle between them from the point of intersection of the
diagonals, this perpendicular will bisect the angle between the diagonals.

5. If two pairs of opposite sides of a cyclic hexagon be respectively parallel to each other,

the remaining pair of sides are also parallel.

6. If two circles intersect in the points A, B, and any two lines ACD, BF E, be drawn
through A and B, cutting one of the circles in the points C, E, and the other in the points
D, F , the line CE is parallel to DF .

7. If equilateral triangles be described on the sides of any triangle, the lines joining the
vertices of the original triangle to the opposite vertices of the equilateral triangles are concur-
rent.

8. In the same case prove that the centres of the circles described about the equilateral

triangles form another equilateral triangle.

9. If a quadrilateral be described about a circle, the angles at the centre subtended by the

opposite sides are supplemental.

10. The perpendiculars of a triangle are concurrent.
11. If a variable tangent meets two parallel tangents it subtends a right angle at the centre.
12. The feet of the perpendiculars let fall on the sides of a triangle from any point in the

circumference of the circumscribed circle are collinear (Simson).

Def.—The line of collinearity is called Simson’s line.
13. If a hexagon be circumscribed about a circle, the sum of the angles subtended at the

centre by any three alternate sides is equal to two right angles.

PROP. XXIII—Theorem.

Two similar segments of circles which do not coincide cannot be constructed

on the same chord (AB), and on the same side of that chord.

Dem.—If possible, let ACB, ADB, be
two similar segments constructed on the
same side of AB. Take any point D in the
inner one. Join AD, and produce it to meet
the outer one in C. Join BC, BD. Then
since the segments are similar, the angle ADB is equal to ACB (Def. x.),
which is impossible [I. xvi.]. Hence two similar segments not coinciding cannot
be described on the same chord and on the same side of it.

86

PROP. XXIV.—Theorem.

Similar segments of circles (AEB, CF D) on equal chords (AB, CD) are

equal to one another.

Dem.—Since the lines are equal, if AB be applied to CD, so that the point
A will coincide with C, and the line AB with CD, the point B shall coincide
with D; and because the segments are similar, they must coincide [xxiii.]. Hence
they are equal.

This demonstration may be stated as follows:—Since the chords are equal, they are con-

gruent; and therefore the segments, being similar, must be congruent.

PROP. XXV.—Problem.

An arc (ABC) of a circle being given, it is required to describe the whole circle.

Sol.—Take any three points A, B, C in the arc. Join AB, BC. Bisect AB
in D, and BC in E. Erect DF , EF at right angles to AB, BC; then F , the
point of intersection, will be the centre of the circle.
Dem.—Because DF bisects the chord AB and
is perpendicular to it, it passes through the centre
[i., Cor. 1]. In like manner EF passes through the
centre. Hence the point F must be the centre; and
the circle described from F as centre, with F A as
radius, will be the circle required.

PROP. XXVI.—Theorem.

The four Propositions xxvi.–xxix. are so like in their enunciations that students fre-
quently substitute one for another. The following scheme will assist in remembering them:—

In Proposition xxvi. are given angles =, to prove arcs =,
angles =,
arcs =,
chords =;

arcs =,
chords =,
arcs =,

,,
,,
,,

,,
,,
,,

xxvii.
xxviii.
xxix.

,,

,,

so that Proposition xxvii. is the converse of xxvi., and xxix. of xxviii.

In equal circles (ACB, DF E), equal angles at the centres (AOB, DHE) or at

the circumferences (ACB, DF E) stand upon equal arcs.

87

Again, since the angles ACB, DF E are [xx.] the halves of the equal angles
AOB, DHE, they are equal [I. Axiom vii.]. Therefore (Def. x.) the segments
ACB, DF E are similar, and their chords AB, DE have been proved equal;
therefore [xxiv.] the segments are equal. And taking these equals from the
whole circles, which are equal (hyp.), the remaining segments AGB, DKE are
equal. Hence the arcs AGB, DKE are equal.

2. The demonstration of this case is included in the foregoing.
Cor. 1.—If the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral be equal, one of its

diagonals must be a diameter of the circumscribed circle.

Cor. 2.—Parallel chords in a circle intercept equal arcs.
Cor. 3.—If two chords intersect at any point within a circle, the sum of
the opposite arcs which they intercept is equal to the arc which parallel chords
intersecting on the circumference intercept. 2. If they intersect without the
circle, the diﬀerence of the arcs they intercept is equal to the arc which parallel
chords intersecting on the circumference intercept.

Cor. 4.—If two chords intersect at right angles, the sum of the opposite arcs

Dem.—1. Suppose the angles
at the centres to be given equal.
Now because the circles are equal
their radii are equal (Def.
i.).
Therefore the two triangles AOB,
DHE have the sides AO, OB in
one respectively equal to the sides
DH, HE in the other, and the
angle AOB equal to DHE (hyp.).
Therefore [I. iv.] the base AB is equal to DE.

which they intercept on the circle is a semicircle.

PROP. XXVII.—Theorem.

In equal circles (ACB, DF E), angles at the centres (AOB, DHE), or at
the circumferences (ACB, DF E), which stand on equal arcs (AB, DE), are
equal.

Dem.—If possible let one of
them, such as AOB, be greater
than the other, DHE; and sup-
pose a part such as AOL to be
equal to DHE. Then since the
circles are equal, and the angles
AOL, DHE at the centres are
equal (hyp.), the arc AL is equal
to DE [xxvi.]; but AB is equal
to DE (hyp.). Hence AL is equal to AB—that is, a part equal to the whole,
which is absurd. Therefore the angle AOB is equal to DHE.

88

2. The angles at the circumference, being the halves of the central angles, are

therefore equal.

PROP. XXVIII.—Theorem.

chords

In equal circles (ACB, DF E),
equal
(AB, DE) di-
vide the circumferences into arcs,
which are equal each to each—
that is, the lesser to the lesser,
and the greater to the greater.

Dem.—If the equal chords be
diameters, the Proposition is evi-
dent. If not, let O, H be the cen-
tres. Join AO, OB, DH, HE; then because the circles are equal their radii are
equal (Def. i.). Hence the two triangles AOB, DHE have the sides AO, OB
in one respectively equal to the sides DH, HE in the other, and the base AB
is equal to DE (hyp.). Therefore [I. viii.] the angle AOB is equal to DHE.
Hence the arc AGB is equal to DKE [xxvi.]; and since the whole circumference
AGBC is equal to the whole circumference DKEF , the remaining arc ACB is
equal to the remaining arc DF E.

Exercises.

1. The line joining the feet of perpendiculars from any point in the circumference of a

circle, on two diameters given in position, is given in magnitude.

2. If a line of given length slide between two lines given in position, the locus of the
intersection of perpendiculars to the given lines at its extremities is a circle. (This is the
converse of 1.)

PROP. XXIX.—Theorem.

In equal circles (ACB, DF E), equal arcs (AGB, DCK) are subtended by

equal chords.

Dem.—Let O, H be the centres (see last ﬁg.). Join AO, OB, DH, HE;
then because the circles are equal, the angles AOB, DHE at the centres, which
stand on the equal arcs AGB, DKE, are equal [xxvii.]. Again, because the
triangles AOB, DHE have the two sides AO, OB in one respectively equal to
the two sides DH, HE in the other, and the angle AOB equal to the angle
DHE, the base AB of one is equal to the base DE of the other.

Observation.—Since the two circles in the four last Propositions are equal, they are con-

gruent ﬁgures, and the truth of the Propositions is evident by superposition.

89

PROP. XXX.—Problem.

To bisect a given arc ACB.

Sol.—Draw the chord AB; bisect it in D; erect DC at right angles to AB,

meeting the arc in C; then the arc is bisected in C.

Dem.—Join AC, BC. Then the triangles
ADC, BDC have the side AD equal to DB
(const.), and DC common to both, and the an-
gle ADC equal to the angle BDC, each being
right. Hence the base AC is equal to the base
BC. Therefore [xxviii.] the arc AC is equal to
the arc BC. Hence the arc AB is bisected in C.

Exercises.

1. ABCD is a semicircle whose diameter is AD; the chord BC produced meets AD
produced in E: prove that if CE is equal to the radius, the arc AB is equal to three times
CD.

2. The internal and the external bisectors of the vertical angle of a triangle inscribed in a
circle meet the circumference again in points equidistant from the extremities of the base.
3. If from A, one of the points of intersection of two given circles, two chords ACD, AC0D0
be drawn, cutting the circles in the points C, D; C0, D0, the triangles BCD, BC0D0, formed
by joining these to the second point B of intersection of the circles, are equiangular.

4. If the vertical angle ACB of a triangle inscribed in a circle be bisected by a line CD,
which meets the circle again in D, and from D perpendiculars DE, DF be drawn to the sides,
one of which must be produced: prove that EA is equal to BF , and hence show that CE is
equal to half the sum of AC, BC.

PROP. XXXI.—Theorem.

In a circle—(1). The angle in a semicircle is a right angle. (2). The angle
in a segment greater than a semicircle is an acute angle. (3). The angle in a
segment less than a semicircle is an obtuse angle.

Dem.—(1). Let AB be the diameter, C
any point in the semicircle. Join AC, CB.
The angle ACB is a right angle.

For let O be the centre. Join OC, and
produce AC to F . Then because AO is equal
to OC, the angle ACO is equal to the an-
gle OAC. In like manner, the angle OCB is
equal to CBO. Hence the angle ACB is equal
to the sum of the two angles BAC, CBA; but
[I. xxxii.] the angle F CB is equal to the sum
of the two interior angles BAC, CBA of the
triangle ABC. Hence the angle ACB is equal
to its adjacent angle F CB, and therefore it
is a right angle [I. Def. xiii.].
